A list of core terms will be compiled by each branch and added here, by the end of the year (2008).

!width="40%"|terms
!width="60%" |description - discussion
|-
|1. material entity
| definition: currently union of 3 types of BFO objects
new proposed definition: material entity def A
"snap:IndependentContinuant" ("independent_continuant") that is
spatially extended, and its identity of is independent of that of
other entities and can be maintained through time.
ex of usage: collection of random bacteria, a chair, dorsal surface
of the body
(examples chosen to cover the 3 cases)
|-
|2. organism
| - Homo sapiens alternative term natural person, alt term human person is subject to confusion, e.g. as legal term "This is a common offshore legal term meaning a living breathing person as opposed to an unnatural person such as a corporation", thus we chose to have natural person as alternative term
- organism should include dead ones as well
|-
|3. organization
| - We added an instance organization Affymetrix to serve as model/
template for other branches. For example the instrument branch needs
to represent manufacturers. Instances will be added in a separate file
- Affymetrix has been added in the Biomaterial branch file just as an
example how we proceed. Role branch will add a manufacturer role
Relation branch: there is a relation is_manufactured_by, do we need
the inverse is_manufacturer_of? do we need a more generic one
is_supplier and then use roles?
|-
|4. molecular entities
| - instead of adding our own label and preferred term to get rid of
plural form, we should contact external resource and ask for
modification according to OBO Foundry principles. Adding our own form
is not very efficient, and create double display of labels in protege
if both lang tags are set to "en"

Process of adding new subclasses to molecular entities
case of "huge" resources e.g. melanie has a list of 600 fluorochromes
and bjoern a list of 1000 peptides
Proposal is to store these very specific resources in external files
(Bjoern may not want to get 600 fluorochromes when downloading OBI)
|-
|5. chemical entities in solution (mixtures)
|
|-
|6. environmental matter
| - link to envo
- http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=ENVO&termId=ENVO%3A00010483&termName=environmental%20matter
- possibility: mireot environmental matter - issue: current children
of ENVO too broad for us (e.g. bone)
- AI for JM to send email to envo/biomaterial with proposal (change
environmental matter to "material entity", subclasses, and then have
defined class environmental matter, which has quality/role of being
able to host organisms)
|-
|7. macroscopic part of organism
|
|-
|8. artifact object
| - issue= an output of mat transfo is artifact - ex: collect something
from street, is it artifact?
- process branch needs to say what mat transformation is (note: has
been renamed artifact material creation) - e.g. we don't want
collection there
- we agree that all output of artifact material creatio will be
artifact object
- AI for BP: work on artifact material creation and check
classification
- AI for BIomaterial branch: review what falls under there

|-
|9. EOO (entity of organismal origin)
| - all EOO should be artifact objects
- "artifact of organismal origin": intent to collect sthg that was
part of organism
- blood serum should be linked to blood as macroscopic part of
organism
- BP: extracted heart is no longer an heart, as parthood relation
don't hold anymore
other example: finger part of hand not true anymore if severed finger
- we need relation "severed finger used to be finger"
- Alan's proposal: having finger (anat structure) and subclasses
finger in vivo and severed finger
- other anatomy ontology don't work that way -> would create issues in
re using them
- AI for BP: have one example blood and heart/finger
