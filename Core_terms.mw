A list of core terms will be compiled by each branch and added here, by the end of the year (2008).

|-
|1. material entity
| definition: currently union of 3 types of BFO objects
new proposed definition: material entity def A
"snap:IndependentContinuant" ("independent_continuant") that is
spatially extended, and its identity of is independent of that of
other entities and can be maintained through time.
ex of usage: collection of random bacteria, a chair, dorsal surface
of the body
(examples chosen to cover the 3 cases)
|-
|2. organism
| - Homo sapiens alternative term natural person, alt term human person is subject to confusion, e.g. as legal term "This is a common offshore legal term meaning a living breathing person as opposed to an unnatural person such as a corporation", thus we chose to have natural person as alternative term
- organism should include dead ones as well
|-
|3. organization
| - We added an instance organization Affymetrix to serve as model/
template for other branches. For example the instrument branch needs
to represent manufacturers. Instances will be added in a separate file
- Affymetrix has been added in the Biomaterial branch file just as an
example how we proceed. Role branch will add a manufacturer role
Relation branch: there is a relation is_manufactured_by, do we need
the inverse is_manufacturer_of? do we need a more generic one
is_supplier and then use roles?
|-
|4. molecular entities
| - instead of adding our own label and preferred term to get rid of
plural form, we should contact external resource and ask for
modification according to OBO Foundry principles. Adding our own form
is not very efficient, and create double display of labels in protege
if both lang tags are set to "en"

Process of adding new subclasses to molecular entities
case of "huge" resources e.g. melanie has a list of 600 fluorochromes
and bjoern a list of 1000 peptides
Proposal is to store these very specific resources in external files
(Bjoern may not want to get 600 fluorochromes when downloading OBI)
