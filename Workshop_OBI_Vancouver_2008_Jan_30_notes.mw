==Wednesday January 30 Notes==

==Barry Smith Role, Relation==

* Time - OBI should deal with only biomedical investigations. Numbers, Time are outside OBI
* Information Ontology will be worked on by Alan and Barry
* Roles
  * if there is a red curtain in the theatre, the redness is not a role in this context
  * if a grid is split into 1km squares, km is not a role
  * need a word for reln between parameter, variables, and the investigation that uses these in PA - BS suggests SETTING as these are not roles like patient role

MC:you say that parameter, hypothesis, objective will live in Protocol. If you modify param during PA, is that a new PA?

BS:No, PA are changeable. If we set voltage outside param we need to ammend the protocol, maybe create a new one

BP:We always said that the we are looking at the end of the PA, and modify Protocol.

<b>BS:In a protocol have a spec of a parameter, realize info entity, gets realized in a 2 stage process, when experimenter adjusts machine, and then when the machine runs with that setting.</b>

BS:also state what will be measuring in the protocol

JF:what about the drug dosage

BS:same as a protocol setting

HP:what about the variables relating to the materials used in the protocol

PRS:this is still part of the protocol, similar to the inclusion criteria for a study. I think is part of the protocols

BS:may be part of protocols that are applied, not nec. specified in the chain.

HP:was thinking more about relation to experimental design, and how that is represented

JW:for me it's characterizing state of the input and the output

BS:agree, but inputs have choice

JW:where there are variable where these are not factors need to record these as well

RS:Think this deals with a lot of issues, analyte, factor, you are talking about kinds of factor now - settings, variables, when you realize these they become qualities of the instrument, the evaulant etc

AR:can be a process, can be a disposition

BB:includes serial no of the device, lot no of the reagent

BP:how implement? we have protocol, we need specification, and a relationship

BS:we need a partonomic analysis of protocols, some will be optional some will be necessary

AR:was hoping that we could use relations rather than rebuilt the h.archy

BS:if we make is specification, makes it easier as is realizable info entity 

BP:this would be parallel to how we use role, tree for specifications

RS:now we need to deal with PA and investiagtion. Variables are spec at the level of investigation, as at the PA level dealing with analytes.

BS:this is an old issue. I think simple soln is that protocol doesn't specify all in planned processes, if you add all together gets specified.

BP:plan has an objective and specifies instructions. 

BS:someone needs to create an anatomy of a protocol so we know which bits are optional

JW:where does this deal with the characterization of input and output

BP:new relationship that allows us to talk about specifications that do not come to reality

PRS:do we just need a relation specifies

<b>AI:move hypothesis, dt role, stat factor from role, add under new class specification suggest a new role - specifies? Plan/PA branch</b>


RS:we specify that we need to use organ liver - so we'll have an organ specification and will need to point to other ontologies

BS:yes, and for data format that would be also specified here.

RS:and  that's where you point to other ontologies

BS:dealt with all cases where processes are bearing roles now, and resolved that

RS/BP:Sham surgery has a role

AR:bees dancing

BS:continuants have optional qualities, can lose parts, occurents have all their qualities and parts, can't lose or gain. If a process goes faster it's not acquired a new feature. 

BP:bees dancing, communication is a planned process, objective is to send a message. Mock surgery is a planned process where the objective is to have a control

BP:This is in objective, we tie a process and the why in objective

BS:the process is not taking a role

<b>AI:processes can't bear roles, objective is used instead for e.g. negative control - this has been added to the action item wiki</b>

PRS:if objective is realizable entity then is a cardinal part of a protocol, 

BS:as a specification

BP:all protocols have an objective.

BS:plans have constant and variable parts. Some things are left open. True of all parts and the whole plan. Objective will have some parts that are specific and some that are left open. The fact that plans are structured with constant and variable, we might specify coarse and fine objective e.g. cure for cancer, vs test a response to a drug in mouse liver. When we say objective, this is an info entity, the mult descriptions are possible.

PRS:want to be 100 sure. Objective is a planned process?

BS:objectives exist in plan and the realized objective. Need label these.

AR:objective, and achievement, or outcome?

BS:planned objective and realized objective?

PRS:sailing a boat, goal is to sail to India, I find USA. I don't realize the objective - what have I done

BP:you revise the planned objective

AR:Plan and Protocol now merged in to a single file


Roles:
 * RO has class and instance level relationships. 
 * OBI needs instance and instance_type relationships
 * uniquely_identified is needed for the serial number instrument relationship
 * issue with this relationship and URI as used by the semantic web needs to be resolved
 * some instance level relations are primitive, some can be defined, not addressed in RO paper
 * OBI needs to define it's instance level relns in terms of simpler instance level relns and this has not been done in logical statements.
 * don't use names of related things in the relation name AR:thinks this is a consistency check and useful

<b>AI:BS will send out some notes on logical definitions for instance level relations to relations branch to prevent relation explosion.</b>

=Melanie Courtot, Instrument Branch==

* OWL file up to date
* terms submitted are included
* finishing meta data clean up
* minor issues
* poor coverage, mostly flow cytometry
* issue with manufacturers and how relate to branch content
* expecting NMR, chromatography, NMR not in first draft
* current content=first working release
* need to discuss how import OWL files and what are the constraints
* consensus will be granualar only to support specific use cases
* role and function confusion


<b>AI:communities to send terms to instrument branch to improve coverage. BB will send an OWL file for BIRN microscopy and imaging</b>

BB:for BIRN we have microscopy and some imaging, we have all the meta data. If I submit as OWL would that be useful?
