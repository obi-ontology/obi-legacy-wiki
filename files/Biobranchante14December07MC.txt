A virus should probably not be an organsim:
- Organism is an individual living system (such as animal, plant, fungus or micro-organism). from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism
- A virus is not living.http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=origin06 (important distinction in astrobiology)

Maybe we could create a separate categories for viruses, viroids and prions?


General Note: 
I think it would make sense to try and import terms from the following ontologies (cf https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/OntologyImports)
- taxonomy (then we don't need to duplicate the hierarchy in 4/, with eukaryotes etc)
- chebi objects: not in biomaterial if doesn't encompass chemicals. If it's really needed should then probably be imported too.
- allele etc. are defined in the sequence ontology, which is also an OBO ontology, so we should probably avoid having it as well
- CARO covers cell, organism, organ and cell_component
- Ryan pointed out the Cell ontology, which is also an OBO ontology and contains cell types information (eg B_cell), so we could probably remove the cell sub-tree above from the biomaterial branch.


5/ in vivo, in vitro, and counterparts should be somewhere else. Maybe under qualities?

6/ immortal_cell: is a cell with a "quality" of being immortal. We might want to add for example cell_line, with a subclass HeLA_cell which would have the quality immortal?
There seems to be duplication:
	immortal_cell
	and
	cell_line
	   |_ immortalized_cell_line
       and
       cell_line_culture. 

Should culture be a process and go to the material_transformation branch?

on a side note, cell_line sound similar to strain and cultivar, which all have that notion of common ancestor, maybe could be grouped in some way?

7/ differentiation should probably be submitted to material_transformation branch (under protocol_application), with genetic_modification

8/ natural and artifical are qualities.
For example artifically_engineered_biomaterial, a virus can be natural or artificial.

9/ supernatant, emulsion, solution, suspension, lysate should probably be removed from the biomaterial branch: did we reach a decision about them on the dev list? roles, qualities?
->item added on the agenda of the dev call on the 5/12/2007

10/ organism_status should be removed, is actually used a synonym for pre or post_mortem (cf definition).
 pre or post_mortem should be submitted to qualities.

11/ entity_of_organismal_origin: the definition is circular (is an entity from an organism) I think. I am not clear with what it represents.

12/ screening_library doesn't belong to biomaterial I think, cf the definition: it's a collection.
I think it should go with the "sets" in denrie. Maybe as a term library, with role screening?
the same apply for cDNA_library and phage_display_library.

13/ synthetic polypeptide can probably be represented as a polypeptide with quality "artificial"

14/ bronchial_alveolar_lavage: it's a collection of biomaterial, should probably be removed.
NOTE: maybe we need to find a way to express the collection of biomaterial when they are very specific. In the above example it seems to be a commonly used solution. In the same way, buffers (eg PBS buffer under liquid_chemical_solution) or commonly used mixtures like BSA may need to be stored somewhere.

15/ cell_culture_supernatant: supernatant will be a role. Should culture be submitted as a material_transformation? (cf 6/ above)

16/peptide_construct: possibly a peptide which is synthetic (artificial) with an additional quality/role (non-linear, has_branch)?

17/ transgenic_organism: transgenic is a quality (cf immortal, natural....). 
Note: after checking, transgenic can be natural or artificial, so shouldn't be put as a child of artificial in the quality branch.

18/ whole_mount_preparation is a process (cf def: histological preparation) should probably be moved to material_transformation

19/ bead: doens't seem to belong to the biomaterial branch. Maybe a labware? 
Could have qualities like fluorescent, magnetic....

20/ dye: I agree with Daniel who put a note there, it sounds more like a role. Acrinidine Orange is a nucleic acid used to dye.

21/ cell_pellet: should probably be just pellet and be a role (counterpart of supernatant)

22/ homogenous_substance: homogenous should maybe be added as a quality

23/ individual_organism: the definition says "identifier or name of the source organism". I would propose to apply a property hasName or hasID applied to organism

24/ vector: I would propose to change the name to cloning_vector. The term recombinant_vector_cloning is in material_transformation and they use the term cloning vector in the definition, and also because it would disambiguate with for example a vector as trasnmission agent.
