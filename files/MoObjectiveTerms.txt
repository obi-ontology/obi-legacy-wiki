termName	definition	parentTermbiological_feature_identification_objective	The aim of the study is designed to examine or characterize a particular biological feature.	objectivemolecular_feature_identification_objective	"The aim of the study is designed to examine or characterize molecular features of a biological system, e.g. expression profiling, copy number of molecular components, epigenetic modifications.  "	biological_feature_identification_objectivesequence_feature_identification_objective	"The aim of the study is designed to examine or characterize molecular features exhibited at the level of a macromolecular sequence, e.g. nucleic acid, protein, polysaccharide.  "	biological_feature_identification_objectiveorganism_feature_identification_objective	"The aim of the study is designed to examine or characterize a biological feature monitored at the level of the organism, e.g. height, weight, stage of development, stage of life cycle.    "	biological_feature_identification_objectivecellular_feature_identification_objective	"The aim of the study is designed to examine or characterize a biological feature monitored at the cellular level, e.g. stage of cell cycle, stage of differentiation."	biological_feature_identification_objectivemethodology_testing_objective	The aim of the study is to examine the effect of using different methodologies.  	objectiveprotocol_testing_objective	The aim of a study is designed to examine the effects of using different protocols.	methodology_testing_objectiveprotocol_optimization	The aim of the study is designed to identify the best protocol.  This may be carried out by comparing different protocols or by modifying the parameters used within a single protocol.                                                         	protocol_testing_objectivehardware_testing_objective	"The aim of the study is designed to examine the effects of using different hardware, e.g. scanner."	methodology_testing_objectivehardware_optimization 	The aim of the study is designed to identify the best hardware. 	software_testing_objective	"The aim of the study is designed to examine the effects of using different software or software parameters, e.g. data processing software."	hardware_optimization software_optimization	The aim of the study is designed to identify the best software or parameters of the software.	software_testing_objective
