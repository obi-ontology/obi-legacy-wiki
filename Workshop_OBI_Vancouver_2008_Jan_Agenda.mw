=OBI Workshop - Vancouver, January 28th - February 1st=

==Draft agenda (items for discussion)==

'''General issues to consider'''

* When to move Protege 4. Cost Benefit Analysis

* Collaborative development Protege (for Protege 3.x and Protege 4) and implications to metadata handling (DS).

* Collaboration with W3C HCLSIG Experiment Ontology effort

* Some methods are using the distance in the ontology to compute data. What happens for these if we choose to use roles, which tends to "flatten" the hierarchy?

* discussion on analyte, stimulus

* ambiguity of usage between roles and qualities (RS): maybe grouping roles/relations and function/qualities together for a discussion?


'''Issues addressed by the agenda below'''

* [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=90B06673D826C64E8ED8EEA6B6FDF8CA0219005D%40crcmail1.BCCRC.CA interaction with roles branch] Data transformation has identified some terms that we consider to be roles, these will be submitted to Roles branch in due course. The interaction of the dt and roles branch and design considerations is what we would like to discuss with all branches

* Suggestion from DT to running whole group sessions in the pm and running parallel branch specific sessions in the am (or vice versa). Can the venue support that? Suggestion is to have branch meetings first before main meetings get really started. Would the lead editor indicate if they want to meet on the milestone spreadsheet.

* Discussion of polysemy and ways to solve that, DT have examples
* Representing mappings to other ontologies in OBI. DT will map to MO terms by the workshop and they want discuss representation of that in OBI

** Discussion on where there are multiple branch implications e.g. algorithms and their application. Where to build, how to ensure consistency

* A session focused on use cases and assessment strategies.  We are at a stage now where this is going to be critical for OBI to be recognized as useful and adopted.

*  Engineering methodology, from the motivations (why are we here what is the problem(s) we are trying to address). 

*  We should add language to distinguish from function and relations.  possibly a good candidate for a discussion at the face-to-face. 

* BYOUC. Bring your own use cases. Richard Scheuermann: I volunteer to present a use case related to infectious disease research.


==Agenda detail==

*'''Monday 28/01'''

morning: Use Cases

afternoon: Use Cases

Presentation of use cases. We expect 1 use case per "group" coming (+ Lilly)
10 min presentation, 20 min discussion

'''''outcome:''''' list of requirements for OBI/tools to fulfill

end of day dedicated to general discussion 



*'''Tuesday 29/01'''

''agenda for  [[BranchBreakout|Branch Individual breakout]]''


morning: Individual branch breakout

Branch lead editor hosts the branch break out. Has the option to nominate somebody to replace him/her though.


''agenda for  [[BranchMixedBreakout|Branch Mixed breakout]]''


afternoon: Mixed branch breakout 

- plan and protocol_application

- relations and role 

- data_transformation and DENRIE

- function and qualities

- instrument and biomaterial




'''''outcome:''''' summary of issues 


*'''Wednesday 30/01'''

morning:Branch reports

afternoon: Branch reports

Branch leader summarizes discussion/issues within his/her branch
1h per branch is allocated (20min presentation general status/issues, 40min discussion)
Roles and relations, having general impact, will be the first ones.

End of the day: discussion about remaining issues

'''''outcome:''''' issues solved and identification of remaining issues 


*'''Thursday 31/01''' - Parallel sessions

Session 1 - General policies

Engineering methodology, from the motivations (why are we here what is the problem(s) we are trying to address).

Discussion on where there are multiple branch implications e.g. algorithms and their application. Where to build, how to ensure consistency

Other concerns raised by members:
- formalize "why do we try and avoid multiple inheritance?"

Session 2 - OWL technicalities

Ontology mapping: how do we import other ontologies in OBI cf https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/OntologyImports

Representing mappings to other ontologies in OBI. DT will map to MO terms by the workshop and they want discuss representation of that in OBI

Discussion of polysemy and ways to solve that, DT have examples


'''''outcome:''''' issues solved, with a practical example when applicable 


*'''Friday 01/02'''

Propose clear milestones.
Proposal for sub-milestones and shorter deadlines. Mechanism to follow up/centralize progress.
eg:
end february -> terms clean (definition, metadata)
end march -> hierarchy clean
...
