=OBI Workshop - Agenda=

==Draft agenda (items for discussion)==

'''General issues to consider'''

* When to move Protege 4. Cost Benefit Analysis

* Collaborative development Protege (for Protege 3.x and Protege 4) and implications to metadata handling (DS).

* Collaboration with W3C HCLSIG Experiment Ontology effort

* Some methods are using the distance in the ontology to compute data. What happens for these if we choose to use roles, which tends to "flatten" the hierarchy?

* discussion on analyte, stimulus

* ambiguity of usage between roles and qualities (RS): maybe grouping roles/relations and function/qualities together for a discussion?


'''Issues addressed by the agenda below'''

* [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=90B06673D826C64E8ED8EEA6B6FDF8CA0219005D%40crcmail1.BCCRC.CA interaction with roles branch] Data transformation has identified some terms that we consider to be roles, these will be submitted to Roles branch in due course. The interaction of the dt and roles branch and design considerations is what we would like to discuss with all branches

* Suggestion from DT to running whole group sessions in the pm and running parallel branch specific sessions in the am (or vice versa). Can the venue support that? Suggestion is to have branch meetings first before main meetings get really started. Would the lead editor indicate if they want to meet on the milestone spreadsheet.

* Discussion of polysemy and ways to solve that, DT have examples
* Representing mappings to other ontologies in OBI. DT will map to MO terms by the workshop and they want discuss representation of that in OBI

** Discussion on where there are multiple branch implications e.g. algorithms and their application. Where to build, how to ensure consistency

* A session focused on use cases and assessment strategies.  We are at a stage now where this is going to be critical for OBI to be recognized as useful and adopted.

*  Engineering methodology, from the motivations (why are we here what is the problem(s) we are trying to address). 

*  We should add language to distinguish from function and relations.  possibly a good candidate for a discussion at the face-to-face. 

* BYOUC. Bring your own use cases. Richard Scheuermann: I volunteer to present a use case related to infectious disease research.

==Agenda detail==

*'''Monday 28/01'''


CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST


morning: Use Cases

afternoon: Use Cases

Presentation of use cases. We expect 1 use case per "group" coming (+ Lilly)
10 min presentation, 20 min discussion

16:00 PM: Rakhi Bhat (from Lilly) will present her work via teleconference.

'''''outcome:''''' list of requirements for OBI/tools to fulfill

end of day dedicated to general discussion 



*'''Tuesday 29/01''' - Parallel sessions


CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST


Session 1 - General policies - Dorothy Lam Boardroom, ground floor.

How do we resolve difficult development decisions (e.g. long discussion on analyte)
How do we keep track of these decisions?

Engineering methodology, from the motivations (why are we here what is the problem(s) we are trying to address).

Discussion on where there are multiple branch implications e.g. algorithms and their application. Where to build, how to ensure consistency

Other concerns raised by members:
- formalize "why do we try and avoid multiple inheritance?"


Session 2 - OWL technicalities - 14th floor conference meeting room

Ontology mapping: how do we import other ontologies in OBI cf https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/OntologyImports

Representing mappings to other ontologies in OBI. DT will map to MO terms by the workshop and they want discuss representation of that in OBI

Discussion of polysemy and ways to solve that, DT have examples


Afetrnoon - 3pm
* Road map to release: branch dissolution? -> Single OBI file? -> Evaluation? -> Iterate? 


'''''outcome:''''' issues solved, with a practical example when applicable  - roadmap for release process


*'''Wednesday 30/01'''


CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST


Branch review

Each branch will be allocated one hour for discussion. 

Known issues:
- biomaterial: states: in vivo, in vitro, pre and post mortem....
- redundancy between relation and roles
- instrument and biomaterial: how to deal with commercial terms

'''''outcome:''''' summary of issues / status

End of meeting at 4pm, then snow trip to Cypress mountain: https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/January2008Workshop#Snow


*'''Thursday 31/01'''


CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST



Branch review

Each branch will be allocated one hour for discussion. If some time remains at the end of these 2 days we can come back on some of them.

End of the day: discussion about remaining issues

'''''outcome:''''' issues solved and identification of remaining issues 




*'''Friday 01/02'''


CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST



Propose clear milestones.

Proposal for sub-milestones and shorter deadlines. Mechanism to follow up/centralize progress.

eg:

end february -> terms clean (definition, metadata)

end march -> hierarchy clean
...
