<b>Draft agenda (for discussion)</b>

* [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=90B06673D826C64E8ED8EEA6B6FDF8CA0219005D%40crcmail1.BCCRC.CA interaction with roles branch] Data transformation has identified some terms that we consider to be roles, these will be submitted to Roles branch in due course. The interaction of the dt and roles branch and design considerations is what we would like to discuss with all branches

* Suggestion from DT to running whole group sessions in the pm and running parallel branch specific sessions in the am (or vice versa). Can the venue support that?

* Discussion of polysemy and ways to solve that, DT have examples

* When to move Protege 4. Cost Benefit Analysis

* Representing mappings to other ontologies in OBI. DT will map to MO terms by the workshop and they want discuss representation of that in OBI

* Develop and discuss a set of rules for editing and committing the OWL file, esp. removing e.g. branches that are interacting with mult branches esp. roles, and relations. DT has found inputs as roles and properties and this is redundant and needs resolving. We'd like a process for that.
