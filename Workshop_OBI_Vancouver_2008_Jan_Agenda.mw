<b>Draft agenda (for discussion)</b>

* [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=90B06673D826C64E8ED8EEA6B6FDF8CA0219005D%40crcmail1.BCCRC.CA interaction with roles branch] Data transformation has identified some terms that we consider to be roles, these will be submitted to Roles branch in due course. The interaction of the dt and roles branch and design considerations is what we would like to discuss with all branches

* Suggestion from DT to running whole group sessions in the pm and running parallel branch specific sessions in the am (or vice versa). Can the venue support that? Suggestion is to have branch meetings first before main meetings get really started. Would the lead editor indicate if they want to meet on the milestone spreadsheet.

* Discussion of polysemy and ways to solve that, DT have examples

* When to move Protege 4. Cost Benefit Analysis

* Collaborative development Protege (for Protege 3.x and Protege 4) and implications to metadata handling (DS).

* Representing mappings to other ontologies in OBI. DT will map to MO terms by the workshop and they want discuss representation of that in OBI

** Discussion on where there are multiple branch implications e.g. algorithms and their application. Where to build, how to ensure consistency

* A session focused on use cases and assessment strategies.  We are at a stage now where this is going to be critical for OBI to be recognized as useful and adopted.

*  Engineering methodology, from the motivations (why are we here what is the problem(s) we are trying to address). 

*  We should add language to distinguish from function and relations.  possibly a good candidate for a discussion at the face-to-face. 
*  Collaboration with W3C HCLSIG Experiment Ontology effort

* BYOUC. Bring your own use cases. richard scheuermann: I volunteer to present a use case related to infectious disease research.


** Agenda detail

*'''Monday 28/01'''

morning: Use Cases

afternoon: Use Cases

Presentation of use cases. We expect 1 use case per "group" coming (+ Lilly)
10 min presentation, 20 min discussion

'''''outcome:''''' list of requirements for OBI/tools to fulfill

end of day dedicated to general discussion 



*'''Tuesday 29/01'''

morning: Branch breakout

afternoon: Branch breakout 

Branch lead editor hosts the branch break out for the whole day. Has the option to nominate somebody to replace him/her though.

'''''outcome:''''' summary of issues 


*'''Wednesday 30/01'''

morning:Branch reports

afternoon: Branch reports

Branch leader summarizes discussion/issues within his/her branch
1h per branch is allocated (20min presentation general status/issues, 40min discussion)
Roles and relations, having general impact, will be the first ones.

End of the day: discussion about remaining issues

'''''outcome:''''' issues solved and identification of remaining issues 


*'''Thursday 31/01'''

Engineering methodology, from the motivations (why are we here what is the problem(s) we are trying to address).

Representing mappings to other ontologies in OBI. DT will map to MO terms by the workshop and they want discuss representation of that in OBI

Discussion of polysemy and ways to solve that, DT have examples

Discussion on where there are multiple branch implications e.g. algorithms and their application. Where to build, how to ensure consistency

'''''outcome:''''' issues solved, with a practical example when applicable 


*'''Friday 01/02'''

Propose clear milestones.
Proposal for sub-milestones and shorter deadlines. Mechanism to follow up/centralize progress.
eg:
end february -> terms clean (definition, metadata)
end march -> hierarchy clean
...
