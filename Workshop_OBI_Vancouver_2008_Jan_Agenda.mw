What are the objectives of the workshop?

**Ensure OBI, when complete, can address the requirements of the participating communities
***Develop list of requirements for OBI/tools to fulfill 
**Ensure branch development (and thus initial release of OBI) can be completed in a timely manner
***Develop list of issues that need to be resolved for branch development to finish, and where possible propose solutions
***Develop realistic roadmap for completion with milestones and responsibilities
**Develop general policies for OBI development to address administrative issues

**Have fun

*'''Tuesday 29/01'''





Branch review


Each branch will be allocated one hour for discussion. If some time remains at the end of these 2 days we can come back on some of them.

format: 10 min presentation, 50 min discussion

morning: 9-12

9-10: CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST

10-11: Plan branch (Philippe)

11-12: Qualities

* discussion with PATO
* term collection


afternoon: 13-16

13-14: Function (Bill)

14-15: Role (Jennifer)

15-16: Relations (Liju) 


* ambiguity of usage between roles and qualities (RS): maybe grouping roles/relations and function/qualities together for a discussion?

* definition of a role: currently processes can't be bearer of roles. A role is not context dependent as pointed out by Alan, it is more related to "socially sanctioned". The general notion of role has to be clarified, for a lot of people function is something inherent to the object you consider (e.g. heart is pumping blood) whereas a role is something context dependent (e.g. protein plays a reagent role in this experiment). This should be explained by Barry and Alan in more details.

* instrument: what is the function and what is the role

* redundancy between relation and roles?



'''''outcome:''''' summary of issues / status

End of meeting at 4pm, then snow trip to Cypress mountain: https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/January2008Workshop#Snow


*'''Wednesday 30/01'''


CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST

10-11: DENRIE (Alan)

11-12: Protocol application (Bjoern) 

* protocol_application: natural process: how to represent, how to link to GO. Induction of natural process - a protocol application in which some natural process (usually defined by GO) is set off.

13-14: Biomaterial (Melanie)

14-15: Instrument (Melanie)

* biomaterial: states: in vivo, in vitro, pre and post mortem....currently "states" are under "to_be_fixed"

* biomaterial as a branch name: how do we define it, how do we differentiate between biomaterial and artefact object

* instrument and biomaterial: how to deal with commercial terms

15-16:  Data transformation (James)

16-17: End of the day: discussion about remaining issues (e.g. '''update from EnvO''': what goes there? See [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/Norman-Morrison-GSC-EnvO-Lite-Version.ppt slides from Norman Morrison])

'''''outcome:''''' issues solved and identification of remaining issues 



*'''Thursday 31/01''' - Parallel or Plenary sessions (to be determined by group vote)


CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST (or by teleconference, see remote attendance section for details)

Depending on progress during the previous days, we'll choose to have a plenary session or not on Tuesday morning.


Session 1 - General policies - Dorothy Lam Boardroom, ground floor.

How do we resolve difficult development decisions (e.g. long discussion on analyte)
How do we keep track of these decisions?

Engineering methodology, from the motivations (why are we here what is the problem(s) we are trying to address).

Discussion on where there are multiple branch implications e.g. algorithms and their application. Where to build, how to ensure consistency

Other concerns raised by members:
- formalize "why do we try and avoid multiple inheritance?"

- Some methods are using the hierarchy in an ontology to compute annotation-based similarity measures. What happens for these if we choose to use roles, which tends to "flatten" the hierarchy?

- discussion on analyte, stimulus


Session 2 - OWL technicalities - 14th floor conference meeting room

Ontology mapping: how do we import other ontologies in OBI cf https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/OntologyImports

Representing mappings to other ontologies in OBI. DT will map to MO terms by the workshop and they want discuss representation of that in OBI

Discussion of polysemy and ways to solve that, DT have examples


Afetrnoon - 3pm
* Road map to release: branch dissolution? -> Single OBI file? -> Evaluation? -> Iterate? 
Deprecation policy and other implications if public release.


'''''outcome:''''' issues solved, with a practical example when applicable  - roadmap for release process


*'''Friday 01/02'''


CENTRA CALL: 9-10 PST - Grants opportunities discussion



Propose clear milestones.

Proposal for sub-milestones and shorter deadlines. Mechanism to follow up/centralize progress.

eg:

end february -> terms clean (definition, metadata)

end march -> hierarchy clean
...
