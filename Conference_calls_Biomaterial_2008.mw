==Biomaterial Conference Calls==

=== February 22, 2008 ===

AGENDA ITEMS:

 1. Continue to review the current file
 2. Approve documentation regarding ontology import (cf example B cell in the owl file)

Pending:
 3. [http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pfbdSTOaDf0D9d7wSiNLoVw&hl=en_GB Mark priorities for Relation branch] (1 - 3, with 
 3. Review remaining terms in the Biomaterial, identify missing definitions, metadata etc.
 4. Review [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists | dispatcher file]]

----

SUMMARY:

''' 2. approve documentation regarding ontology import'''

Comments:
AR: <br>

- Use sw.neurocommons.org:8890 instead of ashby as the sparql endpoint. Same
machine, but more durable url.

- Regarding external.owl, people can probably go and edit it directly,
as it is a simple format, or we could have a tab delimited
spreadsheet, which is easy for people ot edit, and generate the OWL
from a script.

'''Decision''':

SUMMARY:

''' 1. Approve documentation of biomaterial'''
as defined class, posted at http://groups.google.com/group/obi-biomaterial?hl=en
cf tracker at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1886742&group_id=177891&atid=886178

Pre-call comments/corrections from Alan:

A. change _defined_biomaterial to _defined_material (already updated in the OWL file)

'''Decision''': Agreed
 
B. We should add appropriate roles to those elements below biomaterial
(deprecated) only after thinking about it and seeing that it makes
sense. Some of them might already be role-like already and we want to
make these defined classes, perhaps. Some might be reagents only, or
specimens only. For example I think blood would be (at least at first
glance) specimen, but not reagent.

'''Decision''': Not discussed

From Frank, Philippe, Alan and Melanie:
 
C. clarify the status of organization and person as placeholders. Possibly will be moved to other ontology in the future?

'''Decision''': More work needed

----


''' 2. Review terms 'removed' by Philippe'''

'''2.1 ecotype is is in two locations'''

Philippe's initial commments:

ecotype is in 2 location -> _move_to_quality
			 -> child of biomaterial
	-move strain OBI_100021 should be moved to quality
	-move ecotype to quality and remove it from biomaterial
	-move differentiation state OBI_100042 to quality
	-move serotype OBI_100020 to quality
	-move genotype OBI_100006 to quality

'''Decision''': move ecotype to obsolete (also check with EnvO). If one needs to create an ecotype this can be done via a defined class and Alan suggest that one can add a comment saying that this is an ecotype. For the 'OBI Instruction Manual' Alan suggests that instances of ecotype are those instances of a given organism class that live in a particular area. 


'''2.2 sample_population OBI_264'''

Philippe's initial commments:

sample_population OBI_264 and children should be a child of population OBI_181
_move-to-aggregate-object: ag object is not used at the moment

	-move cohort OBI_100019 as a child of population OBI_181
	-move cDNA library OBI_1000021 as child of population OBI_181
	-move phage display library OBI_1000029 as child of population OBI_181
	-move screening library OBI_100064 as child of population OBI_181

'''Decision''': agreement could not be reached and the term will be moved to tracker. 
We do not have sufficient use cases for this. If one need to define a population of rat, Alan suggests: population and has_member all rat and has_member cardinality 10, e.g.

For cohort OBI_100019 Alan suggests this is a role. Tina and Alan suggests cohort_role: borne by population, realized in (observation)_study mode_of_participation members are the things studied. 

	
'''2.3 vector  OBI_100038'''

Philippe's initial comments:
 
move to role, also add plasmid,fosmid,clone, artificial chromosome in biomaterial and create defined classes

'''Decision''': Add vector to tracker for Role branch. Need to create defined class for plasmid formally to be decribed as: import class of DNA from ChEBI, that has a role that is realized in the replication process (replicon_function GO), quality linear or circular (both in PATO already) and the mode of partecipation is the thing that is replicated. E.g.from Alan dna_plamid: dna and has_function replicon_function; circular_dna_plasmid: dna_plasmid and has_quality circular (PATO).
Cosmid and fosmid will be similar.


'''2.4 cell culture supernatant OBI_1000023'''

Philippe's initial comments: see _move_to_role supernatant OBI_100036

'''Decision''': This could be a defined class or an asserted, if defined: molecular mixture which has_role supernatant and derives_from cell culture (OBI)


'''2.5 synthetic polypeptide OBI_100065'''

Philippe's initial comments: split into synthetic to quality and polypeptide OBI_100084 -> create a defined class

'''Decision''': This could be a defined class formally defined as: a polypeptide (from ChEBI) which is_output role in protocol application polypeptide_synthesis.


=== February 8, 2008 ===
Agenda items:
 1. Discuss material (and biomaterial), reagent, input, output, consumed (propose definitions/ branches for these and how they relate to each other)
 2. Documentation for material
 3. Re-view and update the branch editors' list (continuity is beneficial for everybody)
 4. Review [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists | dispatcher file]]

Summary:

'''3. Re-view and update the branch editors' list (continuity is beneficial for everybody)'''

Jennifer has asked to be removed from the editor list, no other vounteer has come forward.

----

'''1. Discuss material (and biomaterial), reagent, input, output, consumed (propose definitions/ branches for these and how they relate to each other)'''

REAGENT, INPUT, OUTPUT

Go to Role branch (they are there now  input_role, output_role, reagent - Alan)

CONSUMED

We bounce this back to Instrument and Role as this does not belong to this branch. Is not a good term and will suggest to replace it with 'used'  in definitions that say 'consumed' (for the moment done already by Alan in the definition of reagent). However we feel this is negative term as something that has gone cannot play a role and we are not happy with it. "Maybe 'discarded' and 're-used or retained' be a better way to deal in instrument rather than in terms of annotation of what is now absent" (from Helen)

MATERIAL, BIOMATERIAL

We will not try to differentiate between aggregate, object, and fiat object part, because it doesn't work well for OBI.  OBI spans many levels of granularity and for this reason we cannot effectively use the three BFO level granularity model. Therefore we remove the difference using this strategy of saying: it is any of the material like entities in BFO. Material is any of bfo:Object, bfo:ObjectAggregate, or bfo:FiatObjectPart.  

Following this strategy we have moved both Biomaterial and Instrument under Material - assuming that the Instrument branch will review and agree on this change. Biomaterial is renamed Biomaterial(deprecated) as all the subs will be removed from it and we make a defined class for it (described below)

Since there was a class Population (or SamplePopulation) in the initial hierarchy(were in TheRest.owl), we have also created Organization and Person asserted classes (under Material) to cater for individual and groups of individual, and match the level of granularity agregate and fiat.

We have created a '_defined_material' helper class and placed under this a 'biomaterial' class to be able to automatically classify material class with the right restrictions. All children of 'biomaterial' will be inferred.



----
Action items for next call:


Approve final version of the documentation

DOCUMENTATION:

- Original version [[Media:MaterialDocumentation.doc]] 



Philippe will move terms that do not belong to Biomaterial branch. 

***HOW TO HAVE PROTEGE TO CHECK INFERRED CLASSES AND MOVE THEM TO RELEVANT DEFINED CLASSES:


If you are working with a stable distribution of Protege, i.e Protege 3.3.1, do the following

1. Get a reasoner,(Racer pro in my evaluation but one could try pellet available here: http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/performance.shtml):
More information about reasoners can be obtained from: http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/api/ReasonerAPIExamples.html

Racer Web Site: http://www.racer-systems.com/products/download/education.phtml Note: I have selected the educational license from the racer download page and followed the regsitration process + instructions for installation (very straightforward).

The installation process should start Racer reasoner. 
If it does not, you will have to start it manually (click the Race reasoner icon)

2. Run an SVN-Update and open the OBI protege project

3. For testing purpose, pick one of the biomaterial class, e.g. blood_plasma and add the following restriction:

has_role some (specimen_role or Reagent)

Save the owl file.

4. go to Protege Menu 'OWL' -> 'Classify Taxonomy'... (remember, for this to work, Racer reasoner must be running)

5. A pop-up window named 'Connected to Racer' shows-up and reports on progress. close it by clicking on 'OK'

6. et voila! just have a look at the new Subclass Explorer pane which has open.

7. look for the helper class '_defined_biomaterial' (Created for testing purpose during a biomaterial branch call) and expand it
expand biomaterial and the inferred class should show up in blue.

Note: The reasoner might complain a bit (see message below) but still manages to infer the blood plasma should be a child of the defined class 'Biomaterial' which shows up in blue in the Protege pane. 

Possible error message from Racer, complaining complaints about cell_coculturing
(has_input min 2) and
(has_input only http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl#OBI_1000022)<- this statement is causing an report : " the current version of DIG interface does not support quantifier restrictions on datatype properties.Ignoring this restriction and attempting to continue..."

*****END-TO BE MOVED- to DOCUMENTATION PAGE

=== January 18, 2008 ===

We discussed 'investigation' who is defining this? 

'''ACTION from Bjoern'''

Come up with definition.

We reviewed Melanie/James proposed change on the existing terms.
There changs are below, along with our comments ('''C''') decisions ('''D''') and actions.

---- 
'''Move these to PATO:'''

1.  emulsion: an emulsion is a mixture of two immiscible substances. One
substance (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the
continuous
phase).

2. solution: a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or
more
substances. In such a mixture, a solute is dissolved in another
substance,
known as solvent.

3. suspension: a suspension is a heterogenous fluid containing solid
particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. The internal
phase
(solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid).

'''D'''

Temporary solution is to create a new entiry 'mixture' under independent continuant and leave the formal definitions open: so that this class will hold the above terms.

'''ACTION for SAS''': 

ask Chris/George if it is still true that PATO only includes 'natural qualities' only, or also 'experimental qualities'.

----

'''Move to ROLE:'''

3. supernatant: is the role of a liquid floating above non-soluble
solids/precipitates

4. provider: there is already supplier in role, with reagent supplier,
subject provider and technology provider as children. If we define
biomaterial as object with role sample or reagent, maybe we should
suggest
to replace reagent supplier with biomaterial supplier, and add an
alternative term provider to the parent term supplier.

5. pellet: is the role of the concentrated component of a mixture that
has
been centrifuged (note: wikipedia seems to consider precipitate as a
synonym, however I don't think it is the case, pellet refering to
centrifugation whereas precipitate is the solid formed during a
chemical
reaction. Precipitate could be an other role and precipitation could
go
under material separation in the protocol application branch.
Precipitate is
also mentioned in the definition of supernatant above)

6. precipitate: role of a solid formed during a chemical reaction.

7. dye: role of substance capable of staining or coloring defined
targets

'''C from Bjoern''' prior call

- I would like to understand why emulsion, solution and suspension are
not materials and / or what the bearer of these qualities would be.

- Provider role / supplier role: This has been going back and forth
between branches. The use case is that people want to specify a
provider for a material. How will that now be achieved? I don't think
that is necessarily for this branch to solve, but we need to keep in
mind that people were submitting this to the biomaterial branch in
order to make this link, not because they were assuming that providers
are biomaterials.

- transcription, translation and precipitation are already in the
protocol application branch

'''D''' 

Closer integration among branches, e.g. provider, to be solved at the workshop.

The 'provider' is a synonim of 'supplier', remove 'reagent supplier'


------

'''Move to PROTOCOL_APPLICATION:'''

8. transplantation: an operation in which an organ or tissue is
transplanted

with children

9. xenotransplantation:  is the transplantation of living cells,
tissues or
organs from one species to another such as from pigs to humans

10. allotransplantation: is the transplantation of organs between
members of
the same species.

11. autotransplantation: is the transplantation of tissue from one part
of
the body to another in the same individual. )

12. transcription: transcription is the process by which genetic
information
from DNA is transferred into RNA. DNA sequence is enzymatically copied
by
RNA polymerase to produce a complementary nucleotide RNA strand .
(note: there is already reverse_transcription under
material_transformation)

13. translation: translation is the second stage of protein
biosynthesis,
during which messenger RNA is decoded to produce a specific
polypeptide
according to rules specified by the genetic code.

14. precipitation: formation of a solid in a solution during a chemical
reaction (possibly a child of material separation)

'''D'''

yes.

'''ACTION for Bjoern'''

Take this terms for inclusion. 


-----

'''Delete:'''

15. population: is already under object_aggregate: flag for deletion

'''D'''

Yes, delete.

-----
Other terms as mentioned in the OWL file:

'''move to quality:'''

16. natural biomaterial (and child ecotype)

17. unicellular organism

18. in vivo biomaterial

19. artificially engineered biomaterial

20. organism status (pre or post mortem)


'''D'''

16. and 19. Alan: says these are not 'quality'; also hard to define a boundary between 'natural/artificial' and we should not make such division; Bjoern: says that e.g. 4 is an the output of a material transformation. 
Create defined class that is the 'output of a material transformation' (name to be renamed in future) and a sybling 'output of a environmental material collection' (somehow related to ecotype).

17. There is no group in the taxonomy to distinguish between e.g. immortal cell line or single cell; that is why we have this term. Bjoern: we nee to place both 'unicellular' and 'multicellular' under organism
Alan: says CARO has 'multicellular' CARO:0000012   

18. Not move: we need to apply specific use cases. 
[What about a 'xenograft'? Wikipedia says that these terms a quality of how the process is done.  Note that this only apply to 'multicellular' organisms, but what about parasites?]

----

'''move to aggregate'''

21.cDNA library

22.cohort

23.strain

----


''' move to relations '''

24. cell derived from multicellular organism

'''D'''

=== January 11, 2008 ===
Melanie recap the work she is doing with James:
* Clean up individual metadata' terms: definitions, editors etc
* Find place in hierarchy

Proposal to keep '''Biomaterial''' as '''name of the branch''', but with the following '''definition: object and has_role (sample role or reagent role)'''.
While Device would be an object and ((has_role some instrument_role) or (has_part some (has_role some instrument_role)))

Bjoern will put the following question to Barry: "How are roles associated with classes of objects? Does the fact that one object in one context has a role transfer this to the class, or does only the object at the moment it plays the role has the role?"

What do we do with terms like 'allele' or 'gene', are these Biomaterial? If it is 'gene record' then is not, moved to other branch, but when referring to the polymer, then yes, but with other name, e.g. 'nucleotide sequence'.

In the next call (Jan 18th) we will review the latest list of terms according to proposed definition.

=== January 04, 2008 ===
General discussion on the biomaterial branch.
Proposal to solve ontology imports.
Decision on cleaning up the tree: general clean-up of the terms (definition, metadata...) without worrying about position at the moment. Hopefully this will help us to clarify things for further steps.

=== December 14, 2007 ===

Summary
* We reviewed [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists| group 1 ]] file terms and definitions which were problematic
* Bjorn and Alan will follow on 'name/label' issue (e.g. Hela cell, my123 cell, Balb/s mice strain -> source vs name) 


----


Action items on biomaterial_purity and allele with PATO. George is happy to have input. I suggested material_purity over biomaterial purity and he's considering it. Allele - PATO uses an external vocab. I've asked what this is, they'll discuss adding to PATO and get back to us.

SUMMARY:
* Biomaterial terms divided among editors accoring to provenence
* Editors start refining definitions and adding examples (instances/child of that class)
* There are only 5 calls before the July workshop: we aim to have all definitions for all the terms and a hierachy (in excel at in owl for the protocol_application branch)

Items for next call:
* Review definitions, non contentious things need not be discussed first

Next call is 8 June 2007, 16.30 BST

SUMMARY:
<br>
* Focus of this call was (only) to sort terms for their relevance to this branch (or belonging to other OBI branches or to PATO, SO, [[ChEBI]] etc)

- This is would be an issue for all the branches; a mechanism need to be identified, meanwhile each community needs to mantain a mapping file
* If an editor decide to do some work on the spreadsheets (resulting from this call) he/she should notify the other editors, so we do not duplicate the work

Items for next call:

File produced after this call: [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists|Post 2nd Mar 2007 call]]<br>

[[BiomaterialTermNeeds/calls/2_Mar_07|MINUTES]] <br>
SUMMARY:<br>

We started with review of BP's terms. Decided that anything that's gene or protein related will wait till later as there is 1. overlap with e.g. SO and special needs to describe chimaerics that cover everyone's term lists. Some people had flagged overlap, and some hadn't so needs to be revisited and maybe a guideline set.
Minor points, some things are retained as placeholders even though we know that they may exist in other ontologies. Some are clearly not in scope and are flagged as such in the 'comment' field of the file.
Range e.g. age range, density range need to be kept in mind as we need a generic way of dealing with range.

Action items:
- AA1. Helen to clean up the spreadsheet and repost it<br>
