Action items on biomaterial_purity and allele with PATO. George is happy to have input. I suggested material_purity over biomaterial purity and he's considering it. Allele - PATO uses an external vocab. I've asked what this is, they'll discuss adding to PATO and get back to us.

Summary
* We reviewed group2 file definitions which were problematic
* Tina and Philippe were assigned terms from the group 2 file
* Susanna will follow up with Jennifer if she can define her terms and by when
* We need to consider what a Biomaterial vs. a Material is - impacts on granularity of definitions and will affect heirarchy

[[DetailedNotes]]

SUMMARY:
* Biomaterial terms divided among editors accoring to provenence
* Editors start refining definitions and adding examples (instances/child of that class)
* There are only 5 calls before the July workshop: we aim to have all definitions for all the terms and a hierachy (in excel at in owl for the protocol_application branch)

Items for next call:
* Review definitions, non contentious things need not be discussed first

Next call is 8 June 2007, 16.30 BST

(Susanna, Helen, Tina, Alan, Bjorn, Philippe, James)

SUMMARY:<br>

* Focus was to sort terms for their relevance to other OBI branches, and external ontologies
* Actions assigned to editors to submit/discuss specific terms:
* AA:HP/JM to check SO/Chebi for terms
* AA: BP submit terms to Protocol Application branch
* AA: SAS submit terms to PATO and Unit Ontology
* AA: JF (Jennifer, not present) submit terms to Clinical Ontology
* AA: PRS submit terms to Plan branch
* AA: NM (Norman, not present) submit terms to Environmental Ontology
* AA:Alan to talk to Barry re: qualities of occurent such as approximate''doubling''time - and doubling-time-units - should this be handled at the level of BFO terms 'seeding''density (density of seeding)' and 'approximate''doubling_time' terms
* AA: HP to report back on anatomy ontologies, what's available by species
* AA: HP and TW to collect instances from MO and ensure these are represented
* Discussions to make with the larger dev list:
* What about dealing with quasi material terms e.g. Lot number, serial number. Should these be dealt with in some generic object attributes as they affect multiple branches
* What to do about cases where there are multiple ontologies that have overlapping terms, anatomy ontologies for e.g and sources of nucleic acid terms (SO/Chebi/ etc) some generic policy for design and what to feed bac to the communities

File produced after this call: [[ https://www.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/BiomaterialTermNeeds/lists|Post 9th Mar 2007 call |]]

SUMMARY:<br>
- Focus of this call was (only) to sort terms for their relevance to this branch (or belonging to other OBI branches or to PATO, SO, [[ChEBI]] etc)
- Definitions, exact name for each term or binning, was not within the scope of this call, this will be tackled later, once we have a core list
- AA1. ~BioMaterial an aggregate or an object? To be discussed with Barry
- AA2. Susanna to submit terms identified as beloging to PATO (use their tracker and cc to Chris M.)
- AA3. Bjoern will take 'Chromosomal''Aberration''Classification' to the Protocol_Application branch and discuss its relevante to PATO with Chris M.
- AA4. There is the issue with merging/splitting terms and mantaining the mapping with its original source
   - This is would be an issue for all the branches; a mechanism need to be identified, meanwhile each community needs to mantain a mapping file
- If an editor decide to do some work on the spreadsheets (resulting from this call) he/she should notify the other editors, so we do not duplicate the work

Items for next call:
- Complete the review of terms (sorting by relevance to this branch)
- Add and discuss terms from Env community (only if Norman is on the call)
- Review pending actions (from the last 2 calls)

Next call: 16 March 2007, 16,00 GMT. Susanna will host again.<br>

[[ [[BiomaterialTermNeeds]]/calls/2''Mar''07|MINUTES|]] <br>
SUMMARY:<br>

We started with review of BP's terms. Decided that anything that's gene or protein related will wait till later as there is 1. overlap with e.g. SO and special needs to describe chimaerics that cover everyone's term lists. Some people had flagged overlap, and some hadn't so needs to be revisited and maybe a guideline set.
Minor points, some things are retained as placeholders even though we know that they may exist in other ontologies. Some are clearly not in scope and are flagged as such in the 'comment' field of the file.
Range e.g. age range, density range need to be kept in mind as we need a generic way of dealing with range.

Action items:
- AA1. Helen to clean up the spreadsheet and repost it<br>
- AA2. Jennifer to clean up her terms some need discussion with MO e.g. death etc<br>
- AA3. Make contact with Luisa with some guidelines re: filtering the PSI lists<br>

- AA4. Identify all gene/protein related terms save and get back to these later when we've completed the  first cut of all the term lists and got placement etc.<br>

Next call we could <br>
1. Discuss the MO terms<br>
2. Develop a core list<br>
3. PSI terms will be filtered off line for relevance to biomaterial branch, and will report back<br>
4. Helen/other mo person needs to suggest placement the MO terms in OBI<br>

5. term  names need a clean up a la naming conventions<br>
6. We need to id terms for other branches and propose them<br>
7. Helen P and Jennifer will look into death type terms off line

Next call: 9 March 2007, 16,00 GMT. Alan will host again.<br>
