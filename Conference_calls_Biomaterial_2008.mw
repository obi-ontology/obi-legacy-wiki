==Biomaterial Conference Calls==


=== October 3rd 2008 ===

focus on representing solutions.<br>

Proposed working example: Tris solution has components tris and water. We will define a tris solution, then assign concentration to tris and water, and finally say that the tris solution is bearing the role buffer when the concentrations are in an acceptable range.<br>


=== September 26th 2008 ===


1. protein complexes<br>
PRO doesn't cover complexes, but GO does.<br>
protein complex mireot-ed from GO http://amigo.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/term-details.cgi?term=GO:0043234<br>
definition: Any macromolecular complex composed of two or more polypeptide subunits, which may or may not be identical. Protein complexes may have other associated non-protein prosthetic groups, such as nucleotides, metal ions or carbohydrate groups.<br>

2. mixture<br>
more precisely: solutions, gas, alloy, emulsion, suspension<br>
solution can be split into multiple portions that are also solutions with the same components: Portion of molecular matter - ensemble of molecules<br>

has_granular_part relation:<br>
ex portion of water has_granular_part H2O molecule (and not water has_granular_part water) => has_granular_part: idea of composition, there also need to be a large number of H2O molecule, idea of identity to the whole is necessary but not sufficient of has_granular_part<br>

Definition: Granular parts are the constitutent parts of Pluralities. They are of the same sort. Generally pluralities have a high number of grains. The loss of a grain has no effect on the sortality of the identity of the plurality<br>

Example tris solution: has_granular_part H2O, has_granular_par tris: we import H2O and tris from chebi and create tris solution in OBI<br>
<br>
Problem: how do we deal with concentration?<br>
<br>
We started discussing this, but didn't conclude. The discussion is to be resumed during next biomaterial call.<br>

Few initial notes:<br>
AR: initial attempt https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/images/5/57/Concentration.pdf - some issues, like for example if no zinc in sample what does the concentration quality inheres in?<br>
BP: it would be nice to have an easy construct like Material has_granular_part (H20, 25%)<br>

BP: Tris buffer has_granular part H20<br>
Tris buffer has granulart part Tris<br>
Tris buffer has component (all H20 molecules in buffer) (where all H2O molecules in buffer = scattered portion of water)<br>

scattered poriton of water has_concentration (25% by mass)<br>
<br>
AR: from tris has_quality concentration_of_water (value 25%), one can imply that tris has_granular_part molecule of H2O<br>

====>>>> we would like to end up specifying element and concentration and get the rest

(molecule and is_granular_part_of solution) has_concentration X <br>
for example: (H2O and is_granular part of tris buffer) has concentration 25%<br>

Note: we probably need to define a range of concentration, 1-25% to have for example the role buffer.
so we need to define the tris solution based on its granular parts, and the buffer role that it plays if the components are in an acceptable range of concentration.


=== September 19th 2008 ===

- mireot<br>
-- AR will try and improve scripts<br>
Sometimes neurocommons is notup-to-date with latest ontologies versions, and causes extra information not to be loaded properly, requiring manual checks<br>
-- JM will check on status with protege people, to be done during OWLED workshop: we will present the mireot mechanism and this will probably foster interactions with developers present<br>

- mixture<br>

-- mixture are composed of different elements, will have properties as well.<br>
-- concentration will be defined or not, people will have choice to specify them or not<br>
-- start with material entity and has_part A, has_part B...<br>
future possible: if part B in such proportion has properties 'buffer"<br>
AI for PRS: liaise with CHEBI people, check if this seems like an acceptable solution and if they can work out a template together.<br>

- function branch?<br>

-- questions about how to edit that branch: who is responsible?<br>
e.g., obi_function term seems to be a placeholder and we might consider deleting it.<br>

- JM tiny clean-up of branch, on AR's latest email model<br>
-- to be examined during next call<br>

- next steps for the biomaterial branch?<br>

-- PRS: digested DNA -> connect adjectives to the PA that cause them to appear<br>
2 options:<br>
1. biomaterial has_quality irradiated and is_output_from PA irradiation<br>
2. irradiated results_from PA irradiation<br>

"results_from" is a new relation that would need to be created, and would allow linking directly a protocol to its effects (e.g. irradiation PA -> irradiated) without need for a bearer (version 2)

<br>
version 1 is currently possible, as all required elements are in the ontology, and in this case we would have a link between the bearer and the "historical_role"<br>

PRS will start going through to the file, implementing solution 1.<br>
PRS will drop line to Chris Mungall for relation "results_from" and inclusion in ro.<br>

- defined classes<br>
currently in buckets at top (_defined protocol application, _defined_material)<br>
proposal from AR to have mini buckets positioned as needed by editor (e.g. I need a biomaterial defined class, I add a placeholder "_defined_classes" when editing the file, and this get removed by script when release<br>
divergent opinions on this, MC fears people will add mini-buckets with various syntaxes, and current solution seems satisfactory.<br>

- by next release (october), replace DENRIE with IAO in OBI<br>

=== September 12th 2008 ===

Proposed changes from AR:

1. peptide, currently OBI_0100083 -> CHEBI:16670
agreed.

2. enzyme = defined class
(protein or has_part some protein) and has_function some GO:0003824
(catalytic activity)

Note from BP that there are RNA enzymes as well.
Agreed on: (protein or rna) or has_part (protein or rna) and has_function some GO:0003824
(catalytic activity)

We will import molecular function with parent function
We will import GO:0003824 with parent molecular function

We will also import  CHEBI:23367 molecular entities, with parent material entity.

Amino acid CHEBI:33709 will be imported as well and will be a child of molecular entities (we will fix the label to be singular in our import, Alan to fix code to respect this. Original one will be kept as alternative term. For terms where we have obi:preferred term we will store that in external.owl and this will take precedence over the rest)

3. DNA Polymerase = defined class
enzyme and  has_function some GO:0034061 (DNA polymerase activity)
4. Reverse transcriptase = defined class
enzyme and has_function some GO:0003964 (RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity)

GO:0003824 catalytic activity to be imported, which child GO:0034061 DNA polymerase activity

AI for BP: check on pro and definition or protein, does it cover complexes?


5. recombinant plasmid = plasmid and output of some <appropriate material
transformation>

recombinant plasmid is already output of recombinant plasmid construction process.
We need the term "plasmid" to move forward.

We will create our own defined class for plasmid:
plasmid = DNA and has_quality circular and has_function (is_realized_as some gene expression) GO:0010467
circular is to be imported from SO:0001235: "A region containing at least one unique origin of replication and a unique termination site."

6. environmental matter (formerly known as environmental sample) rename
"environmental matter" and move rest to editor note.
agreed.

7. anatomical entity currently OBI_0100015 -> CARO:0000000
we decided against this import: current definition in CARO reads:"Biological entity that is either an individual member of a biological species or constitutes the structural organization of an individual member of a biological species" This would cover individual organisms as well and is not desired.
This class will be renamed to "organism part" with definition "An organism part is a part of organism's anatomy or substance arising from an organism from which the biomaterial was derived, excludes cells. E.g. tissue, organ, system, sperm, blood or body location (arm)."

8. cell compartment currently OBI_0100054 ->? membrane-bounded organelle GO:0043227
agreed.
Current parent cell component which was imported from CARO will be replaced by GO import of GO:0005575

AR will experiment with declaring the CARO and GO classes as equivalent.


Postponed: 
- mireot system: how to make it easier for people to use?
- mixtures (cf email from Bjoern: http://groups.google.com/group/obi-biomaterial/browse_thread/thread/eb81a4e80556f8e4?hl=en)



=== June 13th 2008 ===

1. moving person under eukaryote<br>
 all agree - AI for PRS<br>
2. xenograft as role<br>
 is a role borne by a tissue which has been transplanted<br>
 pb (BP): refers to thing in the past<br>

 cut a branch of tree and put it on new tree<br>
 xenograft is coming from 1st PA: taking sample<br>
 when put on new tree<br>
 plays its role xenograft in new process = growing on tree<br>
 pb of "history" of PA<br>

 can we use is preceded by?<br>
<br>

big problem - digested material<br>
can not say what it is without saying where it comes from<br>
and no longer plays the role<br>
e.g. digested enolase is not anymore an enolase (no function, structure)<br>

digested_enolas is derived from enolase and output of digestion<br>
defined class in biom?<br>
<br>
digested is a role played by the output of a digestion protocol<br>
role is defined during process<br>
when process finished<br>

role ends<br>
AI for BP to contact BFO and ask about "states" (whatever the name)<br>
<br>
cf http://groups.google.com/group/bfo-discuss/browse_thread/thread/822b421c64a804a1<br>
e.g. irradiated, digested<br>

state related to process<br>
process leads to that state<br>
irradiation process induces state "irradiated"<br>
material is state of dependent continuant  (e.g. material is irradiated)<br>

<br>
biomaterial<br>

- legacy from mage<br>
- everything related to biological stuff<br>
- play with defined class<br>
but now is it really helpful?<br>
unless more constrained, no added value compared to being a material<br>
<br>

agreement on removing it - to be approved by others though<br>
<br>
proposed: send email to biomaterial branch with notes (AI for MC)<br>
saying we want to remove biomaterial<br>
if everybody ok<br>
we send to obi-dev mentionning it doesn't change what we have which are material entities<br>

<br>
current: biom as sample or reagents<br>
<br>
sample is_a material that has_role sample_role<br>
<br>
sample is material that realizes role sample_role<br>
enolase plays role sample_role<br>

sample container, contains sample<br>
reagent is material that has_role reagent role<br>
sample seems to be useless like that - better example with reagent<br>

=== May 30th 2008 ===

Summary of AI:<br>
AI for JM: move physical_document from therest.owl <br>
AI for JM: Subclassing of defined classes for dev call<br>

AI for AR: check deprecation of properties<br>
AI for BP: how to link is manufactured by and output of PA together<br>
AI: JM to contact AR and ask him to look at biomat and consider the stance of subclassing under defined classes<br><br>




PRS: chromium51 will be in chebi
<br>

few issues mentioned with protege -<br>
AI for JM: move physical_document from therest.owl <br>
e.g. book manufactured by X has_fction communication<br>

<br>
Subclassing of defined classes<br>
to be push to dev call?<br>

AI for JM who is charing next dev call (added to the agenda <br>https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/ConferenceCallAgenda#June_2008)
<br>
- is_manufactured_by = is output of material transformation<br>
material transformation covers building instruments etc...(= assembling sthg with an objective)<br>
<br>
so obsolete is_manufactured_by<br>
(we have to check deprecation of properties)<br>

Note from MC: cf deprecation policy at http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_20cdv87mdw&hl=en, this is already an AI for AR<br>
<br>
is manufactured by person = originator of material transfo process<br>
we need relation is manufactured by, role manufacturer<br>
under manufacturer role can be borne by person and organization<br>
manufacturer role could be subclassed<br>

we need to link is manufactured by and output of PA together (AI for BP to check on that?)<br>
<br>

EOO:<br>
is output of PA (should be mat transfo)<br>
cell of org origin: is output of PA so not part of organism, need to say why this restriction on cell<br>
Cell of Org Origin: def unclear<br>

<br>
pb: classes shouldn't be asserted under EOO<br>
should be moved out, restrictions applied<br>
EOO should be output of mat transfo that has input organism<br>
(we know there are problems with derives_from and the fact of retaining a significant portion of the input, e.g. kill cow to get grass, has input cow output grass but except weird cases should be ok)<br>
<br>
OBSOLETE: curation status deprecated is a beautiful idea with script moving stuff<br>

too painful via protege<br>
<br>
General ideas: we have building blocks and people are picking in there to build what they need<br>
e.g. B cell in liver of mouse: I take B cell, liver and mouse in biom and mix and match<br>

<br>
Agreed: keep on hold modifications to BM branch<br>

go on discussing<br>
then implement if solved with instrument branch<br>
<br>
AI: JM to contact AR and ask him to look at biomat and consider the stance of subclassing under defined classes<br>



=== May 23rd 2008 ===
1. MIREOT <br>

Attendees of the call (BP, PRS, MC) are happy with the current shape of the document at <br>http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_24cp3693dd&hl=en<br>
We propose to send it out to obi-dev for general review by others.<br>
If you have any objection to that please express it now. If none, I will forward the document on Monday to the obi-dev mailing list.<br>
<br>
2. Discussion on primary hierarchy of the branch<br>

<br>
http://groups.google.com/group/obi-developer/browse_thread/thread/ff7361bbbad1c3d1<br>

origin/structure/function<br>
any class under material MUST have at least one of those<br>
either by asserted hierarchy or addition of restriction<br>

<br>

-> potential pb for imports<br>
we can only import is_a hierarchy, so if chebi has a class by structure and has function we can keep only one<br>
<br>

BP: import organism hierarchy form ncbi, all of those imports will be organism, wouldn't feel the need to go into more details (maybe unicell vs multicell but not compulsory)<br>
<br>
PBS discussion<br>

reagent is a role, PBS is under material entity, (all agree)<br>
is_output_ of preparing buffer (material pooling)<br>
has_role buffer role<br>
<br>
We have been discussing mostly about going along the 3 potential axis, origin/structure/function, and we always into one small thing that is unclear for one of us.<br>
Bjoern has a clear plan to reorganize the hierarchy, and he proposed to implement it in owl using the SVN branch mechanism for next week.<br>

This will help us see more clearly how to organize our branch.<br>
There was a general feeling that the sub branches (e.g. children of anatomical entity) were approximately ok, so the major reorganization would happen at the top levels.<br>

=== May 2, 2008 ===

=== April 25, 2008 ===
1. MC sends google doc http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_21csm25rfj&hl=en
to denrie, collects feedback<br>
This has been forwarded to the Denrie branch. Bill had some comments
that he agreed to add in the document, and if possible will join the
call tomorrow to provide more feedback.<br>

Bill joined our call, and gave some feedback regarding this.<br>

- use / instead of # for taxonomy (to not load the whole file when
looking a class)<br>
- organism is a defined class union of 4 top levels<br>

- relation between species and taxon rank like phylum: we import
superclasses so ok (might be done for other ontologies, but on a case
per case basis, for example cell ontology as multiple inheritances)<br>

AR:
when strain, that strain evolved in forced or natural way from some
organism. Question is what do we want to say about that relation
organism-strain?<br>

Use case: C57BL6, hybrid Mus sprettus and Mus musculus, which are
disjoint classes<br>

2 possibilities:<br>
- BL6 is subclass of the union of Mus sprettus and Mus musculus (=
union of the 2 types represents the hybrid (not created as class
though))<br>
- BL6 is subclass from Mus the parent and related to Mus sprettus and
Mus musculus via other relation ("evolved from") (= BL6 asserted as a
type of the proximal parent and other relation to relate)<br>

choice 2 seems to be closer to biological reality<br>

KO mouse: still type of the background organism, not a new strain<br>

birnlex: annotation property saying taxon_rank and point to instance
of enumerated class to say if strain, cultivar etc....<br>
ncbi has list of taxon ranks, that could be combined with jax.<br>

BB might break up from his file so that we could re use it.<br>

AI for next week:<br>
AI: MC to check with BP if he seems ok<br>

AI: depending on BP, finalize taxonomy doc, circulate to obi-dev<br>
AI: AR modifies its script to include annotations like "<has_rank
rdf:resource="http://purl.org/obo/owl/
NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_superkingdom"/>"<br>
AI: BB checks out the owl file generated by Chris M and send him
comments (for later)<br>

2. PRS to check on cultivar with TB<br>
postponed to AI for next week<br>

3. AR, PRS, JM, MC to discuss implementation of MIREOT script(s)<br>
An email has been circulated to start working collaboratively on this.<br>

protege plug-in?<br>
need for specification in any case, e.g. we do something different for
taxonomy and cell import<br>
focus: get specification done,  check for publication on that, maybe
including protege<br>

will focus on the mechanics of the process<br>

using external classes doesn't endorse the external ontology (note
form taxonomy discussion): other ontologies have bugs etc...<br>

AI for next week:<br>
MC: write spec (to be reviewed by all though :-) )<br>
JM: contact Manchester<br>

AR: contact coord<br>

4. JM creates defined class EOO (entity of organismal origin) - AR
will help with definition ("was output of taking sample from organism
and participant in any subsequent protocol application"<br>
or<br>
"output of some protocol application where input was taking sample
from organism")<br>

James will work on that, with definition "output of some protocol
application where input was taking sample from organism"<br>

-> postponed to AI for next week<br>

5. AR thinks about "we need a transitive input_of relation that
traverses output through input and collects pas"<br>

6. AR loads taxonomy.owl in neurocommons for querying<br>
That has been done. cf http://groups.google.com/group/obi-biomaterial/browse_thread/thread/f...<br>

7. There is also a general TODO: we should review jax, check what OWL
representation we could get for that and the 87 from Bill, 1000 from
BP, and see how to deal with those<br>

We might also consider discussing the status of our branch regarding
checks for next release:
http://sw.neurocommons.org/2008/obi/reports/Biomaterial_report.html 
<br>

=== April 18, 2008 ===

1. AR tries to get a dump of jax <br>
dump is available at trunk/src/ontology/catalogs/jax-strains-
email.txt<br>
to discuss: how do we proceed from this text version<br>

<br>
- do uniprot IDs map to that?<br>
- OBI could initiate that project but shouldn't take it on<br>
- review and check what info we want -> owl<br>
- how much are people making their own strains instead using catalogs?<br>
- problem is where to stop? needs more work<br>

- desire of annotate with strains<br>
<br>
todo: we should review jax, check what OWL representation we could get for that and the 87 from Bill, 1000 from BP, and see how to deal with<br>
<br>

2. PRS in protege, define organism as union of the 4 top levels<br>
postponed<br>

<br>
3. MC google doc proposal to biom and denrie<br>
google doc is available at http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dzprnmw_21csm25rfj&hl=en<br>

-> google doc to be forwarded to denrie for feedback<br>

4. AR prototypes script that will fetch superclasses for
externalDerived<br>

people interested (PRS, AR, JM, MC) in the mireot script will work together to find best way to do things



5. BP will review other tax efforts, and provide report/summary<br>
(what
is not in ncbi and is needed)<br>
<br>
- no way to distinguish species and strains in ncbi<br>
- each term in ncbi tax (if we don't care about distinction strain/specie), then we don't have the problem of knowing it is an is_a relation<br>
- each term in ncbi is an instance of organism<br>

- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=226902&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock
<br>
consensus: we go ahead and use ncbi, knowing it has issues<br>
warn that there is a potential pb using classes like clinical sample -> would be better represented in OBI in an other way<br>

as we create things that are not in ncbi, we try to fetch them from other places<br>
Two examples: Uniprot has e.g. mouse strain information and synonyms<br>
http://beta.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10090 (we could for example use their labels/synonyms, even if not ID)<br>
UBio maps multiple taxonomic classifications together<br>
http://www.ubio.org/<br>
should guide us when we need something out of ncbi<br>


6. PRS checks with Tina for cultivar, after we write the proposal<br>
(this action item is to be postponed until we complete the proposal -
just copied here as reminder)<br>
<br>
 
7.lavage: the PA branch added "obtaining lavage sample", with definition "a protocol application to separate cells and/or cellular secretions from an anatomical space by the introduction and removal of fluid", which covers the use case for the bronchial alveolar lavage.
Do we still need a general "lavage" term (or other label) covering the use case "washing/rinsing" a sample?<br>

no need for washing.<br>
the Biomaterial branch should have a defined class "lavage" if requested later on<br>

8. follow up of the discussion regarding entity of organismal origin<br>


AI: AR will define EOO as defined class: was output of taking sample from organism and participant in any subsequent protocol application<br>

or <br>
output of some protocol application where input was taking sample from organism<br>
<br>
AI for James to create defined class EOO<br>
<br>
AI: AR thinks about "we need a transitive input_of relation that traverses output through input and collects pas"<br>

=== April 11, 2008 ===

1. discussion about  organism, strain, cultivar<br>

PRS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar from Wikipedia: Cultivars can be asexual clones or seed-raised.<br>
MC: cultivar synonym of strain for plant<br>

AR: plant strain evolving naturally, human selection -> cultivar<br>

AR: instance of strain or cultivar is an organsim<br>

BP: organism that could be classified as strain, not an instance<br>

AR: class BL6 mouse, instances mice<br>
cultivar_role borne by plant realized in a process where it is selected for propagation because it is pretty or useful<br>
Class Bl6 Mouse. Instances are mice with certain characteristics<br>

Bl6 mouse subclass of organism<br>
organism -> mouse -> bl6 mouse<br>

Bill's file<br>

<br>
benefits: hierarchical relations between species<br>
downside: hierarchical rel in taxonomy unclear: is_a? sometimes, sometimes less clear<br>

<br>
externa.owl includes term<br>
externalDerived.owl includes superclasses<br>

<br><br>
summary<br>

external.owl <- a species asked for<br>

use case mouse BL6<br>
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=10088&lvl=3&p=mapview&p=has_linkout&p=blast_url&p=genome_blast&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock

<br>

mus: http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_100088<br>

asserted class organism<br>
<br>
then, in external.owl: Collect all superclasses, assert subclass/superclass relations between each, including sub/super relation between http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_100088 and immediate parent<br>

<br>

Root of taxonomy:<br>

<br>
in externalDerived we go up superclasses until reaching one of the 5 top levels<br>

then top level subclass of organism<br>

organisms commonly used in molecular research projects:<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana	Escherichia coli	Pneumocystis carinii<br>
Bos taurus	Hepatitis C virus	Rattus norvegicus<br>
Caenorhabditis elegans	Homo sapiens	Saccharomyces cerevisiae<br>
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii	Mus musculus	Schizosaccharomyces pombe<br>

Danio rerio (zebrafish)	Mycoplasma pneumoniae	Takifugu rubripes<br>
Dictyostelium discoideum	Oryza sativa	Xenopus laevis<br>
Drosophila melanogaster	Plasmodium falciparum	Zea mays<br>

organism -> 5 top levels -> remaining classes<br>


<br>
AR loads taxonomy.owl in neurocommons for querying for externalDerived.owl<br>
<br>
BIll made new ids for taxonomy terms which we don't want<br>
=> we don't put "strain" in OBI<br>


cultivar of tulip would be a subclass of tulip, with additional info "cultivar bred for color" would be outside, doesn't go into this hierarchy<br>
AR: cultivar role, with subclass color_cultivar<br>
tulip has role color_cultivar (maybe not role, where else?)<br>



organism would be union of the 4 top levels (7-viroid, other, unclassified), we don't define organism in OBI<br>
things outside of that 5 classes are not organism (eg plasmids)<br>

cross-breed: is a mouse derived from a and derived from B<br>
knock-out mouse, process of making a knock out or defined as lacking a gene<br>

first goal: build the is_a hierarchy, then add additional things as required<br>

http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/000664.html<br>
instructions for users: if you give us mouse, try and give us a jax id<br>

AI: AR tries to get a dump of jax<br>

AI: PRS in protege, define organism as union of the 4 top levels<br>

AI: MC google doc proposal to biom and denrie<br>

2. entity of organismal origin<br>

Comments from Bjoern:<br>
In our work on the IEDB, we noticed that we are really implying two meanings
of 'organismal origin':<br>

(1) was this object part_of or produced by an organism. This is important
when characterizing samples, e.g. 'this blood was taken from a rabbit'.<br>

(2) can objects with the same physico-chemical structure be found in an
organism. This is important to characterize all kinds of man-made objects.
E.g. you are expressing 'rabbit' hemagglutinin in E. Coli, spotting 'human'
DNA probes on a microarray or synthesizing 'viral' peptides.<br>
<br>
relation is_similar_too? no, too fuzzy<br>

could be derived from rabbit expressed in E coli? no, it's not derived from a rabbit (was not taken from rabbit)<br>

protein sequence X, we need to know the origin: either rabbit or synthetized<br>

1/ derived from organism<br>
1/ would be output of PA like extraction or material separation or taking sample from organism<br>

entity of organismal origin is a defined class: is the output of a PA where that process started with taking sample from organism<br>

organism as subclass of entity of organismal origin (assumes chicken came first) and followed only by extraction or material separation<br>

(list of PA to be defined properly)<br>

organism or (part of organism and output of process starting with taking sample from organism followed by only material separations)<br>

follow by only materials -> not followed by anything that is a transformation<br>


No consensus here:<br>
ideas:<br>
- MC: we need to care only about first PA, which would be taking sample from organism. Somebody who wants to go to the source can do it through the successive PAs.<br>
- AR: we need to define the list of authorized PAs to say that it is still derived from organism. e.g. glue is not derived from horse, because some PA that was not acceptable took place<br>
- Bjoern: we don't care about which PAs have been applied. If you want to consider your leather shoes to be of organismal origin it's fine too.<br>


AR: plastic things are therefore entities of organismal origin, old trees -> pressure protocol -> aging protocol -> drilling protocol -> distilling protocol ....<br>


End of discussion.

=== March 14, 2008 ===
Present: MC,JM,PRS
Excused: SAS,BP,AR

Decisions:

i.the children of molecular mixture (namely liquid chemical solution and phosphate buffered saline buffer) will become defined classes-> remains to be done
ii.homogeneous and heterogeneous as quality will be submitted to PATO
iii.molecular mixture will probably be deprecated
iv. regarding point 1b, all classes under biomaterial(deprecated) will have be defined classes with the has_role some(reagent_role or specimen_role) in order to retain more flexibility, with the caveat that all material with role reagent become defined:biomaterial.
v. discussion about subclasses of Organism and taxonomic information (valid for virus, viroid too)

Proposals:
i. cardinal part of organism could be moved as a subclass of entity of organismal origin.This raises somewhat of a conflict between the definition of the 2 classes.
ii.If we stick to the current defintion of cardinal_part_of_organism, this is the realm of CARO and anatomy ontologies and therefore should not be dealt with by OBI

Ation ITEMS
AI: Contact DENRIE for discussion about taxonomic information -> in keeping with the issue of having children of organisms such as Eukaryotes, virus in OBI, or whether to only have leaf element of a Taxonomic/Phylogenic ontology

SUMMARY:

''' 2. approve documentation regarding ontology import'''

Comments:
AR: <br>
- Use sw.neurocommons.org:8890 instead of ashby as the sparql endpoint. Same
machine, but more durable url.

- Regarding external.owl, people can probably go and edit it directly,
as it is a simple format, or we could have a tab delimited
spreadsheet, which is easy for people ot edit, and generate the OWL
from a script.

'''Decision''': ok, accepted



'''3. Terms for Relation branch'''

SUMMARY:

''' 1. Approve documentation of biomaterial'''

cf tracker at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1886742&group_id=177891&atid=886178

Pre-call comments/corrections from Alan:

A. change _defined_biomaterial to _defined_material (already updated in the OWL file)

'''Decision''': Agreed
 
B. We should add appropriate roles to those elements below biomaterial
(deprecated) only after thinking about it and seeing that it makes
sense. Some of them might already be role-like already and we want to
make these defined classes, perhaps. Some might be reagents only, or
specimens only. For example I think blood would be (at least at first
glance) specimen, but not reagent.

'''Decision''': Not discussed

From Frank, Philippe, Alan and Melanie:
 
C. clarify the status of organization and person as placeholders. Possibly will be moved to other ontology in the future?

'''Decision''': More work needed

----


''' 2. Review terms 'removed' by Philippe'''

'''2.1 ecotype is is in two locations'''

Philippe's initial commments:

ecotype is in 2 location -> _move_to_quality
			 -> child of biomaterial
	-move strain OBI_100021 should be moved to quality
	-move ecotype to quality and remove it from biomaterial
	-move differentiation state OBI_100042 to quality
	-move serotype OBI_100020 to quality
	-move genotype OBI_100006 to quality

'''Decision''': move ecotype to obsolete (also check with EnvO). If one needs to create an ecotype this can be done via a defined class and Alan suggest that one can add a comment saying that this is an ecotype. For the 'OBI Instruction Manual' Alan suggests that instances of ecotype are those instances of a given organism class that live in a particular area. 


'''2.2 sample_population OBI_264'''

Philippe's initial commments:

sample_population OBI_264 and children should be a child of population OBI_181
_move-to-aggregate-object: ag object is not used at the moment

	-move cohort OBI_100019 as a child of population OBI_181
	-move cDNA library OBI_1000021 as child of population OBI_181
	-move phage display library OBI_1000029 as child of population OBI_181
	-move screening library OBI_100064 as child of population OBI_181

'''Decision''': agreement could not be reached and the term will be moved to tracker. 
We do not have sufficient use cases for this. If one need to define a population of rat, Alan suggests: population and has_member all rat and has_member cardinality 10, e.g.

For cohort OBI_100019 Alan suggests this is a role. Tina and Alan suggests cohort_role: borne by population, realized in (observation)_study mode_of_participation members are the things studied. 

	
'''2.3 vector  OBI_100038'''

Philippe's initial comments:
 
move to role, also add plasmid,fosmid,clone, artificial chromosome in biomaterial and create defined classes

'''Decision''': Add vector to tracker for Role branch. Need to create defined class for plasmid formally to be decribed as: import class of DNA from ChEBI, that has a role that is realized in the replication process (replicon_function GO), quality linear or circular (both in PATO already) and the mode of partecipation is the thing that is replicated. E.g.from Alan dna_plamid: dna and has_function replicon_function; circular_dna_plasmid: dna_plasmid and has_quality circular (PATO).
Cosmid and fosmid will be similar.


'''2.4 cell culture supernatant OBI_1000023'''

Philippe's initial comments: see _move_to_role supernatant OBI_100036

'''Decision''': This could be a defined class or an asserted, if defined: molecular mixture which has_role supernatant and derives_from cell culture (OBI)


'''2.5 synthetic polypeptide OBI_100065'''

Philippe's initial comments: split into synthetic to quality and polypeptide OBI_100084 -> create a defined class

'''Decision''': This could be a defined class formally defined as: a polypeptide (from ChEBI) which is_output role in protocol application polypeptide_synthesis.

Agenda items:
 1. Discuss material (and biomaterial), reagent, input, output, consumed (propose definitions/ branches for these and how they relate to each other)

 4. Review [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists | dispatcher file]]

Summary:

'''3. Re-view and update the branch editors' list (continuity is beneficial for everybody)'''

Jennifer has asked to be removed from the editor list, no other vounteer has come forward.

----

'''1. Discuss material (and biomaterial), reagent, input, output, consumed (propose definitions/ branches for these and how they relate to each other)'''

REAGENT, INPUT, OUTPUT

Go to Role branch (they are there now  input_role, output_role, reagent - Alan)

CONSUMED

We bounce this back to Instrument and Role as this does not belong to this branch. Is not a good term and will suggest to replace it with 'used'  in definitions that say 'consumed' (for the moment done already by Alan in the definition of reagent). However we feel this is negative term as something that has gone cannot play a role and we are not happy with it. "Maybe 'discarded' and 're-used or retained' be a better way to deal in instrument rather than in terms of annotation of what is now absent" (from Helen)

MATERIAL, BIOMATERIAL

We will not try to differentiate between aggregate, object, and fiat object part, because it doesn't work well for OBI.  OBI spans many levels of granularity and for this reason we cannot effectively use the three BFO level granularity model. Therefore we remove the difference using this strategy of saying: it is any of the material like entities in BFO. Material is any of bfo:Object, bfo:ObjectAggregate, or bfo:FiatObjectPart.  

Following this strategy we have moved both Biomaterial and Instrument under Material - assuming that the Instrument branch will review and agree on this change. Biomaterial is renamed Biomaterial(deprecated) as all the subs will be removed from it and we make a defined class for it (described below)

Since there was a class Population (or SamplePopulation) in the initial hierarchy(were in TheRest.owl), we have also created Organization and Person asserted classes (under Material) to cater for individual and groups of individual, and match the level of granularity agregate and fiat.

We have created a '_defined_material' helper class and placed under this a 'biomaterial' class to be able to automatically classify material class with the right restrictions. All children of 'biomaterial' will be inferred.



----
Action items for next call:


Approve final version of the documentation

DOCUMENTATION:

- Original version [[Media:MaterialDocumentation.doc]] 



Philippe will move terms that do not belong to Biomaterial branch. 

***HOW TO HAVE PROTEGE TO CHECK INFERRED CLASSES AND MOVE THEM TO RELEVANT DEFINED CLASSES:


If you are working with a stable distribution of Protege, i.e Protege 3.3.1, do the following

1. Get a reasoner,(Racer pro in my evaluation but one could try pellet available here: http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/performance.shtml):
More information about reasoners can be obtained from: http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/api/ReasonerAPIExamples.html

Racer Web Site: http://www.racer-systems.com/products/download/education.phtml Note: I have selected the educational license from the racer download page and followed the regsitration process + instructions for installation (very straightforward).

The installation process should start Racer reasoner. 
If it does not, you will have to start it manually (click the Race reasoner icon)

2. Run an SVN-Update and open the OBI protege project

3. For testing purpose, pick one of the biomaterial class, e.g. blood_plasma and add the following restriction:

has_role some (specimen_role or Reagent)

Save the owl file.

4. go to Protege Menu 'OWL' -> 'Classify Taxonomy'... (remember, for this to work, Racer reasoner must be running)

5. A pop-up window named 'Connected to Racer' shows-up and reports on progress. close it by clicking on 'OK'

6. et voila! just have a look at the new Subclass Explorer pane which has open.

7. look for the helper class '_defined_biomaterial' (Created for testing purpose during a biomaterial branch call) and expand it
expand biomaterial and the inferred class should show up in blue.

Note: The reasoner might complain a bit (see message below) but still manages to infer the blood plasma should be a child of the defined class 'Biomaterial' which shows up in blue in the Protege pane. 

Possible error message from Racer, complaining complaints about cell_coculturing
(has_input min 2) and
(has_input only http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontology/OBI.owl#OBI_1000022)<- this statement is causing an report : " the current version of DIG interface does not support quantifier restrictions on datatype properties.Ignoring this restriction and attempting to continue..."

*****END-TO BE MOVED- to DOCUMENTATION PAGE

=== January 18, 2008 ===

We discussed 'investigation' who is defining this? 

'''ACTION from Bjoern'''

Come up with definition.

We reviewed Melanie/James proposed change on the existing terms.
There changs are below, along with our comments ('''C''') decisions ('''D''') and actions.

---- 
'''Move these to PATO:'''

1.  emulsion: an emulsion is a mixture of two immiscible substances. One
substance (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the
continuous
phase).

2. solution: a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or
more
substances. In such a mixture, a solute is dissolved in another
substance,
known as solvent.

3. suspension: a suspension is a heterogenous fluid containing solid
particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. The internal
phase
(solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid).

'''D'''

Temporary solution is to create a new entiry 'mixture' under independent continuant and leave the formal definitions open: so that this class will hold the above terms.

'''ACTION for SAS''': 

ask Chris/George if it is still true that PATO only includes 'natural qualities' only, or also 'experimental qualities'.

----

'''Move to ROLE:'''

3. supernatant: is the role of a liquid floating above non-soluble
solids/precipitates

4. provider: there is already supplier in role, with reagent supplier,
subject provider and technology provider as children. If we define
biomaterial as object with role sample or reagent, maybe we should
suggest
to replace reagent supplier with biomaterial supplier, and add an
alternative term provider to the parent term supplier.

5. pellet: is the role of the concentrated component of a mixture that
has
been centrifuged (note: wikipedia seems to consider precipitate as a
synonym, however I don't think it is the case, pellet refering to
centrifugation whereas precipitate is the solid formed during a
chemical
reaction. Precipitate could be an other role and precipitation could
go
under material separation in the protocol application branch.
Precipitate is
also mentioned in the definition of supernatant above)

6. precipitate: role of a solid formed during a chemical reaction.

7. dye: role of substance capable of staining or coloring defined
targets

'''C from Bjoern''' prior call

- I would like to understand why emulsion, solution and suspension are
not materials and / or what the bearer of these qualities would be.

- Provider role / supplier role: This has been going back and forth
between branches. The use case is that people want to specify a
provider for a material. How will that now be achieved? I don't think
that is necessarily for this branch to solve, but we need to keep in
mind that people were submitting this to the biomaterial branch in
order to make this link, not because they were assuming that providers
are biomaterials.

- transcription, translation and precipitation are already in the
protocol application branch

'''D''' 

Closer integration among branches, e.g. provider, to be solved at the workshop.

The 'provider' is a synonim of 'supplier', remove 'reagent supplier'


------

'''Move to PROTOCOL_APPLICATION:'''

8. transplantation: an operation in which an organ or tissue is
transplanted

with children

9. xenotransplantation:  is the transplantation of living cells,
tissues or
organs from one species to another such as from pigs to humans

10. allotransplantation: is the transplantation of organs between
members of
the same species.

11. autotransplantation: is the transplantation of tissue from one part
of
the body to another in the same individual. )

12. transcription: transcription is the process by which genetic
information
from DNA is transferred into RNA. DNA sequence is enzymatically copied
by
RNA polymerase to produce a complementary nucleotide RNA strand .
(note: there is already reverse_transcription under
material_transformation)

13. translation: translation is the second stage of protein
biosynthesis,
during which messenger RNA is decoded to produce a specific
polypeptide
according to rules specified by the genetic code.

14. precipitation: formation of a solid in a solution during a chemical
reaction (possibly a child of material separation)

'''D'''

yes.

'''ACTION for Bjoern'''

Take this terms for inclusion. 


-----

'''Delete:'''

15. population: is already under object_aggregate: flag for deletion

'''D'''

Yes, delete.

-----
Other terms as mentioned in the OWL file:

'''move to quality:'''

16. natural biomaterial (and child ecotype)

17. unicellular organism

18. in vivo biomaterial

19. artificially engineered biomaterial

20. organism status (pre or post mortem)


'''D'''

16. and 19. Alan: says these are not 'quality'; also hard to define a boundary between 'natural/artificial' and we should not make such division; Bjoern: says that e.g. 4 is an the output of a material transformation. 
Create defined class that is the 'output of a material transformation' (name to be renamed in future) and a sybling 'output of a environmental material collection' (somehow related to ecotype).

17. There is no group in the taxonomy to distinguish between e.g. immortal cell line or single cell; that is why we have this term. Bjoern: we nee to place both 'unicellular' and 'multicellular' under organism
Alan: says CARO has 'multicellular' CARO:0000012   

18. Not move: we need to apply specific use cases. 
[What about a 'xenograft'? Wikipedia says that these terms a quality of how the process is done.  Note that this only apply to 'multicellular' organisms, but what about parasites?]

----

'''move to aggregate'''

21.cDNA library

22.cohort

23.strain

''' move to relations '''

24. cell derived from multicellular organism

=== January 11, 2008 ===
Melanie recap the work she is doing with James:
* Clean up individual metadata' terms: definitions, editors etc
* Find place in hierarchy

Proposal to keep '''Biomaterial''' as '''name of the branch''', but with the following '''definition: object and has_role (sample role or reagent role)'''.
While Device would be an object and ((has_role some instrument_role) or (has_part some (has_role some instrument_role)))

Bjoern will put the following question to Barry: "How are roles associated with classes of objects? Does the fact that one object in one context has a role transfer this to the class, or does only the object at the moment it plays the role has the role?"

What do we do with terms like 'allele' or 'gene', are these Biomaterial? If it is 'gene record' then is not, moved to other branch, but when referring to the polymer, then yes, but with other name, e.g. 'nucleotide sequence'.

In the next call (Jan 18th) we will review the latest list of terms according to proposed definition.

=== January 04, 2008 ===
General discussion on the biomaterial branch.
Proposal to solve ontology imports.
Decision on cleaning up the tree: general clean-up of the terms (definition, metadata...) without worrying about position at the moment. Hopefully this will help us to clarify things for further steps.
