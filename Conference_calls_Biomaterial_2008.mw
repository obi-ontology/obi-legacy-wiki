==Biomaterial Conference Calls==

 A link to the full list of files used for or produced after each call can be [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists| found here.]]


=== February 8, 2008 ===
Agenda items:
 1. Discuss material (and biomaterial), reagent, input, output, consumed (propose definitions/ branches for these and how they relate to each other)
 2. Documentation for material
 3. Re-view and update the branch editors' list (continuity is beneficial for everybody)
 4. Review [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists | dispatcher file]]

Summary:
''this text need to edited during the call, to reflect discussion/agreements''
1. 

Reagent

- reagent (role branch, might need a suffix to disambiguate)
def: "Reagent is a role in which the role-bearing continuant is consumed during an assay or study protocol"

- reagent function
def:"A function inhering a molecule, set of molecules, cell, collection of cells, or tissue enabling it to participate in critical material transformation in the context of a specific investigation plan."

At the workshop we discussed this briefly, and it has been agreed upon that we need to have both, as some material are specifically made to be reagent (cf comment by Richard Scheuermann), and from the biomaterial branch point of view a biomaterial can bear hte role of reagent.

The 2 definitions above are annotated as "incomplete" so I assume the relevant branches will deal with that.

Antibody reagent has been assigned to Philippe on the sourceforge tracker, and I added a comment to this issue there.



=== January 18, 2008 ===

We discussed 'investigation' who is defining this? 

'''ACTION from Bjoern'''

Come up with definition.

We reviewed Melanie/James proposed change on the existing terms.
There changs are below, along with our comments ('''C''') decisions ('''D''') and actions.

---- 
'''Move these to PATO:'''

1.  emulsion: an emulsion is a mixture of two immiscible substances. One
substance (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the
continuous
phase).

2. solution: a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or
more
substances. In such a mixture, a solute is dissolved in another
substance,
known as solvent.

3. suspension: a suspension is a heterogenous fluid containing solid
particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. The internal
phase
(solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid).

'''D'''

Temporary solution is to create a new entiry 'mixture' under independent continuant and leave the formal definitions open: so that this class will hold the above terms.

'''ACTION for SAS''': 

ask Chris/George if it is still true that PATO only includes 'natural qualities' only, or also 'experimental qualities'.

----

'''Move to ROLE:'''

3. supernatant: is the role of a liquid floating above non-soluble
solids/precipitates

4. provider: there is already supplier in role, with reagent supplier,
subject provider and technology provider as children. If we define
biomaterial as object with role sample or reagent, maybe we should
suggest
to replace reagent supplier with biomaterial supplier, and add an
alternative term provider to the parent term supplier.

5. pellet: is the role of the concentrated component of a mixture that
has
been centrifuged (note: wikipedia seems to consider precipitate as a
synonym, however I don't think it is the case, pellet refering to
centrifugation whereas precipitate is the solid formed during a
chemical
reaction. Precipitate could be an other role and precipitation could
go
under material separation in the protocol application branch.
Precipitate is
also mentioned in the definition of supernatant above)

6. precipitate: role of a solid formed during a chemical reaction.

7. dye: role of substance capable of staining or coloring defined
targets

'''C from Bjoern''' prior call

- I would like to understand why emulsion, solution and suspension are
not materials and / or what the bearer of these qualities would be.

- Provider role / supplier role: This has been going back and forth
between branches. The use case is that people want to specify a
provider for a material. How will that now be achieved? I don't think
that is necessarily for this branch to solve, but we need to keep in
mind that people were submitting this to the biomaterial branch in
order to make this link, not because they were assuming that providers
are biomaterials.

- transcription, translation and precipitation are already in the
protocol application branch

'''D''' 

Closer integration among branches, e.g. provider, to be solved at the workshop.

The 'provider' is a synonim of 'supplier', remove 'reagent supplier'


------

'''Move to PROTOCOL_APPLICATION:'''

8. transplantation: an operation in which an organ or tissue is
transplanted

with children

9. xenotransplantation:  is the transplantation of living cells,
tissues or
organs from one species to another such as from pigs to humans

10. allotransplantation: is the transplantation of organs between
members of
the same species.

11. autotransplantation: is the transplantation of tissue from one part
of
the body to another in the same individual. )

12. transcription: transcription is the process by which genetic
information
from DNA is transferred into RNA. DNA sequence is enzymatically copied
by
RNA polymerase to produce a complementary nucleotide RNA strand .
(note: there is already reverse_transcription under
material_transformation)

13. translation: translation is the second stage of protein
biosynthesis,
during which messenger RNA is decoded to produce a specific
polypeptide
according to rules specified by the genetic code.

14. precipitation: formation of a solid in a solution during a chemical
reaction (possibly a child of material separation)

'''D'''

yes.

'''ACTION for Bjoern'''

Take this terms for inclusion. 


-----

'''Delete:'''

15. population: is already under object_aggregate: flag for deletion

'''D'''

Yes, delete.

-----
Other terms as mentioned in the OWL file:

'''move to quality:'''

16. natural biomaterial (and child ecotype)

17. unicellular organism

18. in vivo biomaterial

19. artificially engineered biomaterial

20. organism status (pre or post mortem)


'''D'''

16. and 19. Alan: says these are not 'quality'; also hard to define a boundary between 'natural/artificial' and we should not make such division; Bjoern: says that e.g. 4 is an the output of a material transformation. 
Create defined class that is the 'output of a material transformation' (name to be renamed in future) and a sybling 'output of a environmental material collection' (somehow related to ecotype).

17. There is no group in the taxonomy to distinguish between e.g. immortal cell line or single cell; that is why we have this term. Bjoern: we nee to place both 'unicellular' and 'multicellular' under organism
Alan: says CARO has 'multicellular' CARO:0000012   

18. Not move: we need to apply specific use cases. 
[What about a 'xenograft'? Wikipedia says that these terms a quality of how the process is done.  Note that this only apply to 'multicellular' organisms, but what about parasites?]

----

'''move to aggregate'''

21.cDNA library

22.cohort

23.strain

----


''' move to relations '''

24. cell derived from multicellular organism

'''D'''

---------------------


=== January 11, 2008 ===
Melanie recap the work she is doing with James:
* Clean up individual metadata' terms: definitions, editors etc
* Find place in hierarchy

Proposal to keep '''Biomaterial''' as '''name of the branch''', but with the following '''definition: object and has_role (sample role or reagent role)'''.
While Device would be an object and ((has_role some instrument_role) or (has_part some (has_role some instrument_role)))

Bjoern will put the following question to Barry: "How are roles associated with classes of objects? Does the fact that one object in one context has a role transfer this to the class, or does only the object at the moment it plays the role has the role?"

What do we do with terms like 'allele' or 'gene', are these Biomaterial? If it is 'gene record' then is not, moved to other branch, but when referring to the polymer, then yes, but with other name, e.g. 'nucleotide sequence'.

In the next call (Jan 18th) we will review the latest list of terms according to proposed definition.

=== January 04, 2008 ===
General discussion on the biomaterial branch.
Proposal to solve ontology imports.
Decision on cleaning up the tree: general clean-up of the terms (definition, metadata...) without worrying about position at the moment. Hopefully this will help us to clarify things for further steps.

=== December 14, 2007 ===
Fresh review of the biomaterial branch. Comments file [[Media:Biobranchante14December07MC.txt]]

=== July 6, 2007 ===
* 1. First pass h'archy discussed and OWL file created

===June 15, 2007===
Summary
* We reviewed [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists| group 1 ]] file terms and definitions which were problematic
* Bjorn and Alan will follow on 'name/label' issue (e.g. Hela cell, my123 cell, Balb/s mice strain -> source vs name) 


----


Action items on biomaterial_purity and allele with PATO. George is happy to have input. I suggested material_purity over biomaterial purity and he's considering it. Allele - PATO uses an external vocab. I've asked what this is, they'll discuss adding to PATO and get back to us.

* There are only 5 calls before the July workshop: we aim to have all definitions for all the terms and a hierachy (in excel at in owl for the protocol_application branch)

Items for next call:
* Review definitions, non contentious things need not be discussed first

Next call is 8 June 2007, 16.30 BST

(Susanna, Helen, Tina, Alan, Bjorn, Philippe, James)

SUMMARY:<br>
* Focus was to sort terms for their relevance to other OBI branches, and external ontologies
* Actions assigned to editors to submit/discuss specific terms:
* AA:HP/JM to check SO/Chebi for terms
* AA: BP submit terms to Protocol Application branch
* AA: SAS submit terms to PATO and Unit Ontology
* AA: JF (Jennifer, not present) submit terms to Clinical Ontology
* AA: PRS submit terms to Plan branch
* AA: NM (Norman, not present) submit terms to Environmental Ontology
* AA:Alan to talk to Barry re: qualities of occurent such as approximate''doubling''time - and doubling-time-units - should this be handled at the level of BFO terms 'seeding''density (density of seeding)' and 'approximate''doubling_time' terms
* AA: HP to report back on anatomy ontologies, what's available by species
* AA: HP and TW to collect instances from MO and ensure these are represented
* Discussions to make with the larger dev list:
* What about dealing with quasi material terms e.g. Lot number, serial number. Should these be dealt with in some generic object attributes as they affect multiple branches
* What to do about cases where there are multiple ontologies that have overlapping terms, anatomy ontologies for e.g and sources of nucleic acid terms (SO/Chebi/ etc) some generic policy for design and what to feed bac to the communities

File produced after this call: [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists|Post 9th Mar 2007 call]]

SUMMARY:
<br>
* Focus of this call was (only) to sort terms for their relevance to this branch (or belonging to other OBI branches or to PATO, SO, [[ChEBI]] etc)
* Definitions, exact name for each term or binning, was not within the scope of this call, this will be tackled later, once we have a core list
* AA1. ~BioMaterial an aggregate or an object? To be discussed with Barry

- This is would be an issue for all the branches; a mechanism need to be identified, meanwhile each community needs to mantain a mapping file
* If an editor decide to do some work on the spreadsheets (resulting from this call) he/she should notify the other editors, so we do not duplicate the work

Items for next call:
* Complete the review of terms (sorting by relevance to this branch)

File produced after this call: [[BiomaterialTermNeedsLists|Post 2nd Mar 2007 call]]<br>

[[BiomaterialTermNeeds/calls/2_Mar_07|MINUTES]] <br>

SUMMARY:<br>

We started with review of BP's terms. Decided that anything that's gene or protein related will wait till later as there is 1. overlap with e.g. SO and special needs to describe chimaerics that cover everyone's term lists. Some people had flagged overlap, and some hadn't so needs to be revisited and maybe a guideline set.
Minor points, some things are retained as placeholders even though we know that they may exist in other ontologies. Some are clearly not in scope and are flagged as such in the 'comment' field of the file.
Range e.g. age range, density range need to be kept in mind as we need a generic way of dealing with range.

Action items:
- AA1. Helen to clean up the spreadsheet and repost it<br>
- AA2. Jennifer to clean up her terms some need discussion with MO e.g. death etc<br>
- AA3. Make contact with Luisa with some guidelines re: filtering the PSI lists<br>
- AA4. Identify all gene/protein related terms save and get back to these later when we've completed the  first cut of all the term lists and got placement etc.<br>

Next call we could <br>
1. Discuss the MO terms<br>
2. Develop a core list<br>
3. PSI terms will be filtered off line for relevance to biomaterial branch, and will report back<br>
4. Helen/other mo person needs to suggest placement the MO terms in OBI<br>
5. term  names need a clean up a la naming conventions<br>

6. We need to id terms for other branches and propose them<br>
7. Helen P and Jennifer will look into death type terms off line

Next call: 9 March 2007, 16,00 GMT. Alan will host again.<br>
