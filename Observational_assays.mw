The Biological Collections Ontology [https://github.com/BiodiversityOntologies/bco | (BCO)] has a need to describe an observing process. This is a type of assay in which no specimen is collected and no material processing takes place. BCO curators wanted to know if there should be a class in OBI for "observational assay". See https://sourceforge.net/p/obi/obi-terms/745/.

This topic was discussed at the OBI developer call on June 6, 2016, and '''it was decided that there was no need for a class for observational assay in OBI'''. Per existing OBI use cases, it is already possible to define observational assay fully without a specific class for it. BCO can maintain its class for observing process, and define it according to the needs of BCO. The main use case for BCO is describing biodiversity observations that assert that an organism was present at a particular time and place, but no specimen was collected.

Some examples of observational assays that are already covered by OBI:assay:
-Time measurement assays - records the length of an event
-Counting geese flying over a house
-Age measurement assay

'''Processes as input in an assay:'''

At the same meeting, we discussed the fact that some other ontologies (e.g., OBOE and OML) allow for processes to be the entity that is being analyzed (specified input) in what they call an observation, but which is very similar to OBI:assay. We agreed that the current use cases for BCO and OBI donâ€™t include any cases where there is no material entity that is the evaluant, so BCO should stick with the OBI pattern for assay.

'''Human versus machine observation:'''
 
Distinguish the investigator. OBI is compatible with a robot being the investigator. 
Device is not required for an assay (a human eye could make the observation). 
If the process is clearly defined in the data, then whether the observer is human or machine can be determined in queries, so no need for separate classes in OBI. BCO has classes from Darwin core. Maybe we can just keep the DwC classes as subclasses of BCO:observing process.
