The Biological Collections Ontology [https://github.com/BiodiversityOntologies/bco | (BCO)] has a need to describe an observing process. This is a type of assay in which no specimen is collected and no material processing takes place. BCO curators wanted to know if there should be a class in OBI for "observational assay". See 



2. Assays for biodiversity and earth science studies
The goal for today is to:
Resolve: coordinate assays and observing processes with BCO
Determine if we need a subclass of assay “observational assay” where the assay does not involve any direct physical interaction with the evaluant.
Discuss: Other ontologies have processes as the evaluant.
Resolve: Human observation versus machine observation: https://github.com/BiodiversityOntologies/bco/issues/54
Notes:
Some examples of observational assays in OBI:
-Time measurement assays - records the length of an event
-Counting geese flying over a house
-Age measurement assay
Re. having non-material evaluants: Material thing undergoes a process and you measure it as it undergoes that process. If you don’t want to model the material entity, it can just be a blank node. Generally, it is easier to individuate material entities than processes, though. 
We agreed that the current use cases for BCO and OBI don’t include any cases where there is no material entity that is the evaluant, so BCO should stick with the OBI pattern for assay.

Do we need  a class for observing process in OBI? How to define it?
Could define observing process as disjoint from specimen collection process (which already assay is). Input is not participant in a specimen collection process. 
Decision: Keep observing process in BCO, make it a subclass of of OBI:assay. Define as per use cases in BCO (where the assay does not sample or physically change the evaluant).

Human versus machine observation: 
Distinguish the investigator. OBI is compatible with a robot being the investigator. 
Device is not required for an assay (a human eye could make the observation). 
If the process is clearly defined in the data, then whether the observer is human or machine can be determined in queries, so no need for separate classes in OBI. BCO has classes from Darwin core. Maybe we can just keep the DwC classes as subclasses of BCO:observing process.
