'''About this document'''
<br><br>
This document gives both the rationale and instructions on how to add quick terms to the OBI. A step by step guide should allow anyone to add terms to the OBI, and limited knowledge about the OBI is required. Nevertheless it is strongly recommended to get familiar with ontology design before adding terms to the OBI.<br>
== How to use this document? ==

This page is created both to explain the actual procedure of adding terms to OBI, as it is a description of the idea behind the Quick ID procedure. It is subdivided into different sections, so one can choose to 
<ul>
	<li>Simply ''[[#Submit a term to OBI|learn how to add terms]]''<br>
	The section 'Submit a term to OBI ' describes the procedure on adding terms to OBI. Useful for those who are familiar with OBI and need a simple tutorial on how to add terms.</li>
	<li>Get familiar with the Quick ID procedure<br>
	All other sections are created to help you understand the procedure. This includes:
		<ul>
			<li>''[[#Introduction to the Quick ID|Introduction to the QUICK ID]]''<br>
			A short introduction to Quick ID to get you going.</li>
			<li>''[[#Glossary of Common Terminology|Glossary of common terminology]]''<br>
			This glossary will explain frequently used terms, which hopefully helps to understand this procedure. This glossary is a guide explaining these terms, and refers to those documents with detailed explanation of the particular concept.</li>

== Introduction to the ''Quick ID''? ==

''This section is both an introduction to the ''Quick ID'' procedure. Read through this section if you are not (really) familiar with the Quick ID procedure.''<br>

Quick ID's refers to a procedure developed to ''quickly'' add terms to the OBI (''ID's'' in "Quick ID's" refer to ID's given to the terms when added to the OBI repository). Quick ID's therefore refers to the process of quickly adding terms to the OBI, without the necessity of being a ''core'' developer of OBI. The Quick ID process is a process to allow those individuals who might not be strongly involved in the design of OBI, to add terms to the OBI repository. <br>

Quick Id's are created for those who want to contribute/support to the OBI targeting those individuals who are not directly involved or familiar with ontology design. Adding terms through the procedure of Quick ID, allows for fast additions with a minimal learning curve. It's procedure is despite it (relatively) simplicity, nevertheless very powerful. It's combination of curation and openness enables a fast growing ontology created by and for the community.<br><br>
The benefits of the Quick ID procedure for OBI are:
<ul>
	<li>Direct input from the scientific community</li>
	<li>Input from various fields using a single procedure</li>
	<li>Curate the OBI and maintain influx from the community</li>
	<li>Reduced load on curation through expert input</li>
</ul>
Contributors through the Quick ID benefit from:
<ul>
	<li>Small load on contribution</li>
	<li>Hands on control of the OBI and their domain specific ontology (terminology)</li>
	<li>More robust ontology integration by shared expertise</li>
	<li>Improved speed for the construction and extension of OBI and the domain specific ontology</li>
</ul>

Quick Terms hold a special position within OBI. It is fully part of the OBI, however needs to be curated before being submitted to the OBI. This curation process normally has a small load, and enables the development of a well-structured OBI. 
Initially, a Quick Term has the status of ''uncurated''. This means that these terms are not (yet) part of what you could call the core OBI. A developer of OBI then checks the submitted term and adds it to the OBI. Normally, when the Quick Term is added according the following instructions, this process is semi-automatic.
For a Quick Term to be added quickly to the OBI, it is therefore important to follow the instructions.<br>

Quick ID is created for all who want to add terms to the OBI. The goal of OBI is to create an integrated ontology for the description of life-science and clinical investigations. Anyone involved in the life-sciences or clinical investigations is welcomed to contribute to OBI. The power of OBI is driven by the input of these various fields. The Quick ID process is an expression of this emphasis on open access and development. <br>
Any questions regarding the Quick ID's can be asked ['''here ?mailinglist for Quick ID?''']. 

<br><br>
=== BFO, OBI and Quick ID ===

'''In short'''<br><br>
''Quick ID's is a file ''within'' OBI, and OBI uses BFO as an upper ontology. The Quick ID file allows to add terms into OBI, but needs to be curated before being added to the 'core' OBI repository.''
<br><br><br>
'''BFO'''
<br><br>
''The following information is gathered from BFO and is a (very short) summary which hopefully allows to grasp the basics of the BFO. For a full description of Basic Formal ontology (BFO), go to the [http://www.ifomis.org/bfo BFO website]. ''
<br><br>
An ontology tries to '''represent''' the reality creating a controlled value list (different terms) to describe ('represent') the reality of the domain. A scientific ontology tries to represent the reality investigated by the sciences. But representing such a reality must be valid across various domains in order to exchange our data easily. Constructing specific ontologies only applicable to a specific domain is not very useful since it still does not allow to '''integrate''' the data from those fields. BFO is a framework that allows those various domains to be connected using the BFO framework. 
<br><br>
Therefore the BFO is a top-level (or upper or formal) ontology. It's main characteristics are:
<ul>
	<li>top-level<br>
	As mentioned before it is the overall framework designed to integrate domain ontologies.</li>
	<li>Holds categories containing or representing universals primarily<br>
	The goal of BFO is not to develop ontologies as such, but to organize domain ontologies (e.g. an ontology for the neurosciences, the genetic ontology...). Universals are the 'abstract' or 'general' structure (e.g. "human", "mammal" or "feline"). These universals are the focus of BFO.</li>
	<li>Uses perspectivalism<br>
	Many different representations that are equally good (good in the sense of being true) precisely in that they capture different and important 
features of one and the same reality (different 'perspectives' enhance our understanding of the studied subject).</li>
	<li>It's extended downward<br>
	When the BFO will be extended (cf. 'capture' more and more domains and thus studied subjects) this will be done through its domain ontologies. It is believed that the BFO holds the classes needed for the construction and development of detailed domain ontologies. As such, this framework is thought to be stable and extensive.</li>
</ul>
To sum it up: BFO is a top-level (dealing with only universals, say working on an 'abstract level') ontology (cf. the attempt to describe or represent reality) which allows domain specific ontologies (such as OBI) to describe reality by differentiating between the characteristics (e.g. 'is this a process or not') of the particular element (e.g. 'a heart') one wants to describe.
<br><br><br>
'''OBI'''
<br><br>
The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations project (cf. OBI) is developing an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical investigations (and therefore is a domain specific ontology in contrast with the top-level ontology BFO). This includes a set of 'universal' terms, that are applicable across various biological and technological domains (originating from BFO), and domain-specific terms relevant only to a given domain (OBI specific terms). This ontology will support the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. The ontology will represent the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type analysis performed on it. In other words: OBI uses the 'framework' of BFO and builds an ontology within this framework which allows to connect data from different fields.
<br><br><br>
'''Quick Terms'''<br><br>
The Quick ID file (cf. obi-quick-id.owl) is a specific file within OBI, which (since being part of the OBI) also uses the BFO. It's a protocol developed for those who have values they think are part of the OBI domain specific ontology, but are not core developers of OBI as such. This protocol allows those individuals to add terms in an easy manner. <br><br>
The Quick ID procedure is built around the obi-quick-id.owl file. It's basically a file ''within'' the OBI ontology which holds all newly added terms. Adding a term through the Quick ID adds those terms to the Quick ID file (within OBI). This file is different from other OBI files, due to the fact that all terms initially are 'uncurated'. Though it's part of the OBI, the terms added through Quick ID are not immediately part of the core OBI, but need curation before added to the core OBI. When terms are added correctly this is a semi-automatic process.<br><br>

=== Additional Information ===

When you start out with OBI, it is not surprising that the specific terminology is confusing. Therefore we provide a short [[#Glossary of Common Terminology|glossary of terms]] used in BFO, OBI and Quick ID. It's gives both a short description as (if applicable) where to find additional information. <br><br>
If this document nevertheless does not answer all your questions, you can join our mailinglist for Quick ID.<br><br>

The process for quickly allocating OBI ids for accepted simple cross product terms can be found [[QuickTerms-CrossProducts | here]] along with some [[QuickTerm_CrossProduct_Examples | examples]].

== Submit a term to OBI ==


=== Before you start... ===
When you want to add terms through the Quick ID procedure, it is assumed that you:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>You know how to use the specific software to add the terms to OBI. Quick ID (and OBI in general) uses [http://protege.stanford.edu/ Protege], and we recommend that you download and install [http://protege.stanford.edu/download/prerelease/full/ Protege 3.4]</li>
	<li>You have checked out the latest version of the OBI repository using subversion via the command line or via a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients SVN client] from the [https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/ OBI subversion repository] </li>
	<li>Know how to use the Quick ID file locally following [https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/docs/developer/instructions-svn-local.txt these instructions]</li>
	<li>Know how to [http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_10gk2mcpfb use Protege with OBI]. </li>
	<li>Are aware of the [[OBI_Minimal_metadata|OBI Minimal metadata]]</li>
	<li>Are aware of the [http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Naming OBO Foundry naming conventions]. </li> 
</ul>


=== Set obi-quick-id.owl as the active ontology file ===

{|class="wikitable" valign="TOP"  style="text-align: left; width: 100%; cellspacing:0; cellpadding: 5; background: #FFFFFF; border-left:10px solid white;border-right:5px solid white;"

!  | <font size="-1"></font>
!  | <font size="-1"></font>
|-

|valign="TOP"|
Once selected as active all new classes added to the ontology via Protege will be added to the obi-quick-id.owl file. You can set the obi-quick-id.owl file as the active ontology file following the instructions outlined in section II of the [http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_10gk2mcpfb use Protege with OBI] document. <br><br>

When set as active, the file 'obi-quick-id.owl' (and only obi-quic-id.owl) should no longer be in italic and have a different background color than the other files.

=== Determine the node of the Basic Formal Ontology ===

The following instructions will help you determine where under BFO your term should go and therefore how to describe and annotate it for inclusion within OBI. When submitting a term to OBI consideration should be given as to which node of BFO the term should be inferred under. This section allows you to determine whether the term you would like to add is a 
<ul>
	<li>process</li>
	<li>material entity</li>
	<li>information that describes an entity</li> 
</ul>
Using the definition of process, material entity or information that describes an entitiy (which are all BFO classes), one can determine under which class the particular term should go to. Each term should fit in one of these classes. Therefore, you should start with process and move on untill you found the class appropriate for your Quick Term. It is always a good idea to read through all the classes, even if you 'are sure' which class it should go under. 
<br><br>
Use the following table to determine the class. In the first column you find the actual BFO class and in the second the definition and explanation of the particlar class. Examples are used to further assist you in determining the class. Once you decided which class corresponds to your term, click on the class which brings you to the next step.<br>

[[#Define your term | process]]

|valign="TOP"| 

'' '''Definition''' ''<br>
A "span:ProcessualEntity" ("processual_entity") that is a maximally connected spatio-temporal whole and has bona fide beginnings and endings corresponding to real ''discontinuities''.
<br><br>
'' '''Example: process of sleeping''' ''
<ul>
	<li>''span:ProcessualEntity'' and ''processual_entity''<br>
	Both span:ProcessualEntity and processual_entity come from the terminology used in BFO. In this stage it is not important to know where they are referring to, but you can always check the [glossary] for more information.</li>
	<li>''maximally connected spatio-temporal whole''<br>
	A process has both spatial and temporal 'parts'. Both spatial and temporal parts are tightly connected and therefore defined as 'maximally connected spatia-temporal whole. One example is the '''John's life''' can be described as 'when he was a child', 'when he was an adult'... (= temporal part) and they are tightly connected with the spatial parts as in 'when he lived in Seatle', 'when he lived in New York'... <br>
	In the case of sleeping: sleeping is clearly stretched over time (e.g. from 9am till 1pm) and is tightly connected with the place one was sleeping (in bed, on the couch, in a haystack...).</li>
	<li>''bona fide beginnings and endings''<br>
	The process must have a "real" beginning and ending, a very distinct begin point and end point. <br>
	In the case of sleeping: beginning point = when one begins to sleep, ending point: when one wakes up</li>
	<li>''corresponding to real discontinuities''<br>
	The phase before the beginning point must be clearly distinguishable from the phase after the beginning point: ''here = being awake vs. being asleep''<br>
	The phase before ending point must be clearly distinguishable from the phase after the ending point: ''here = being asleep vs. being awake'''.</li>

| valign="TOP"|
:'''bfo:object'''
| style="border-top:1px dashed grey" |
'' '''Definition''' ''<br>
A bfo:object is a "snap:IndependentContinuant" ("independent_continuant") that is spatially extended, maximally self-connected and self-contained (the parts of a substance are not separated from each other by spatial gaps) and possesses an internal unity. The identity of substantial "snap:Object" ("object") entities is independent of that of other entities and can be maintained through time.<br>
<br><br>
'' '''Example: a heart''' ''
<ul>
	<li>''snap:IndependentContinuant'' and ''independent_continuant''<br>
	Both snap:IndependentContinuant and independent_continuant come from the terminology used in BFO. In this stage it is not important to know where they are referring to, but you can always check the [glossary] for more information.</li>
	<li>''spatially extended''<br>
	Refers to the fact that they take in a certain part of the space, that they have a certain spatial dimension. In the case of a heart, this means that the heart has a particular size.</li>
	<li>''possesses an internal unity''<br>
	The entities in this class have an 'internal unity' as they do not depend on others objects to exist. A heart still remains a heart even when it's removed from the body. It does not depend on the body to be a heart, nor does it depend on any other object to be what it is, namely a heart.</li>
	<li>''maximally self-connected and self-contained''<br>
	Self-connected and self-contained is the fact that all constituent parts are not separated from each other by spatial gaps as opposed to objectaggregate. [footnote MIE 2008]</li>
	<li>''independent of that of other entities''<br>
	This refers to the fact that the entity can exist without the need of other entities to exist, it exists 'on its own'. A rock still exists, even when it's moved elsewhere, it still is a rock. The rock does not need other rocks to exist 'as a rock', nor does it have to be in the dessert to 'be a rock'.</li>
	<li>''maintained through time''<br>
	Maintained through time refers to the fact if the entity exists, all parts of the entity also exist. In the case of a heart, this means that every entity of the heart (such as right ventricle, aorta, cardiac septem) all 'exist' when the heart 'exists'. A heart might be functioning today and not tomorrow, yet it still is the same heart.</li>

:'''bfo:objectaggregate'''
| style="border-top:1px dashed grey" |
'' '''Definition''' ''<br>
A bfo:objectaggregate is a "snap:IndependentContinuant" ("independent_continuant") that is a mereological sum of separate "snap:Object" ("object") entities and possesses non-connected boundaries.
<br><br>
'' '''Example: a flock of geese''' ''
<ul>
	<li>''snap:IndependentContinuant and independent_continuant''<br>
	Both snap:IndependentContinuant and independent_continuant come from the terminology used in BFO. In this stage it is not important to know where they are referring to, but you can always check the [glossary] for more information.</li>
	<li>''a mereological sum of separate "snap:Object" ("object") entities''<br>
	The degree of unity of the objectaggregate is less than the object. In the case of a gooze vs a geeze, it should be clear that the unity is less strong for the flock of geese in comparison to a single goose. Also note, that an objectaggregate consists only out of snap:object, as in a flock of geese is a collection of multiple geese and nothing but geese.</li>
	<li>''non-connected boundaries''<br>
	Where the previous class stated that there were no spatial gaps between the different elements (e.g. in the case of a rock, there is no 'space' between the elements of the rock), this is not the case for an objectaggregate. There are gaps between all or some of its parts. In the example of a flock of geese, there is a gap between goose 1, goose 2, goose 3... (but not between the parts of a goose, which is a snap:object).</li>
</ul>
''' ''Other Examples'' '''
<ul>
	<li>A heap of stones</li>
	<li>A group of commuters on the subway</li>
	<li>A collection of random bacteria</li>

	<li>symphony orchestra</li>
</ul>
|- 
| valign="TOP"|
:'''bfo:faitObjectPart'''
| style="border-top:1px dashed grey" |
'' '''Definition''' ''<br>
A bfo:fiatObjectPart is a "snap:IndependentContinuant" ("independent_continuant") that is part of a "snap:Object" ("object") but is not demarcated by any physical discontinuities.
<br><br>
'' '''Example: the north east of Brussels''' ''
<ul>
	<li>''snap:IndependentContinuant and independent_continuant''<br>
	Both snap:IndependentContinuant and independent_continuant come from the terminology used in BFO. In this stage it is not important to know where they are referring to, but you can always check the [glossary] for more information.</li>
	<li>part of snap:Object but not demarcated by physical discontinuities<br>
	The boundaries between the different parts of an object are natural discontinuous, such as the natural discontinuity of the head of a goose and the neck. However for a Fiat part (cf. fiatObectPart), there is no such clear discontinuity. For the north east of Brussels, there is no clear distinguishable discontinuity, but nevertheless is a distinct part of Brussels. Therefore it goes within the class of snap:fiatObjectPart</li>
</ul>

=== Check consistency ===

=== Submit to the OBI repository ===

=== Examples on how to define your term ===

The best way of getting an idea on how it's supposed to be done, is to browse the OBI repository (which you checked out using SVN). However, for you convenience we provide some examples of Protege both from Quick Terms as from OBI core terms. This will give an insight in how a Quick Term could look like and how a core term of OBI in its final form looks like. They main difference between such Quick Term and a core OBI term is the status of being uncurated as a Quick Term.<br>
The following terms are snapshots and possibly due for change. The following term descriptions therefore are not necessarily the latest versions of the term within OBI. As said, for the latest versions do use Protege itself. They are merely provided as an easily accessible 'first glance' of the terms. <br><br>
The terms are sorted according to the BFO class. The decision to rank them in e specific class are not describes in these examples. Such an explanation can be found in the [[#Determine the node of the Basic Formal Ontology|explanation of the BFO classes]].<br><br>
Hence we end up with the following structure:
*Process
**[[#visual fixation|visual fixation]]: example of a Quick Term using the [[#Define the newly created class|Quick ID procedure]]
**[[#DNA sequence variation detection|DNA sequence variation detection]]: example of core OBI

Not identical to "fixational eye movements" (or fixational instability, retinal jitter). Fixational eye movements refer to the movement (retinal jitter) of the eye ''during'' fixation. Fixation Task refers to the ''task'' to fixate a specific object and does not target the movement of the eye during this task.<br>

Rats are various medium sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. "True rats" are members of the genus Rattus, the most important of which to humans are the black rat, Rattus rattus, and the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus. Many members of other rodent genera and families are also called rats and share many characteristics with true rats.
