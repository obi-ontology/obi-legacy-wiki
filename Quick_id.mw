'''About this document'''
<br><br>
This document gives both the rationale and instructions on how to add quick terms to the OBI. A step by step guide should allow anyone to add terms to the OBI, and limited knowledge about the OBI is required. Nevertheless it is strongly recommended to get familiar with ontology design before adding terms to the OBI.<br>
= How to use this document? =

This page is created both to explain the actual procedure of adding terms to OBI, as it is a description of the idea behind the Quick ID procedure. It is subdivided into different sections, so one can choose to 
<ul>
	<li>Simply '''learn how to add terms'''<br>
	The section 'How to submit a term to OBI to get an OBI ID?' describes the procedure on adding terms to OBI</li>
	<li>'''Get familiar''' with the Quick ID procedure<br>
	All other sections are created to help you understand the procedure. This includes a:
		<ul>
			<li>''' ''Introduction to the QUICK ID'' '''<br>
			A short introduction to Quick ID to get you going.</li>

= Introduction to the ''Quick ID''? =

''This section is both an introduction to the ''Quick ID'' procedure. Read through this section if you are not (really) familiar with the Quick ID procedure.''<br>

Quick ID's refers to a procedure developed to ''quickly'' add terms to the OBI. The Quick ''ID's'' refer to ID's given to the terms one adds to the OBI repository, where ''quick'' refers to the fast input from the user. Quick ID's therefore refers to the process of quickly adding terms to the OBI, without the necessity of being a ''core'' developer of OBI. It is a process to allow those individuals who might not be strongly involved in the design of OBI, to add terms to the OBI repository. <br>
If we use ''Quick ID's'', we refer to the process of adding terms into the OBI. If we use ''Quick terms' we refer to the actual terms added to the OBI. <br>

Quick Id's are created for those who want to contribute/support to the OBI targeting those individuals who are not directly involved or familiar with ontology design. Adding terms through the procedure of Quick ID, allows for fast additions with a minimal learning curve. It's procedure is despite it (relatively) simplicity, nevertheless very powerful. It's combination of curation and openness enables a fast growing ontology created by and for the community.<br><br>
The benefits of the Quick ID procedure for OBI are:
<ul>
	<li>Direct input from the scientific community</li>
	<li>Input from various fields using a single procedure</li>
	<li>Curate the OBI and maintain influx from the community</li>
	<li>Reduced load on curation through expert input</li>
</ul>
Contributors through the Quick ID benefit from:
<ul>
	<li>Small load on contribution</li>
	<li>Hands on control of the OBI</li>
	<li>More robust ontology integration by shared expertise</li>
	<li>Improved speed for the construction and extension of OBI</li>
</ul>

Quick Terms hold a special position within OBI. It is fully part of the OBI, however needs to be curated before being submitted to the OBI. This curation process normally has a small load, however allows for the development of a well-structured OBI. 
Initially, a Quick Term has the status of ''uncurated''. This means that these terms are 'on submission' not part of what you could call the core OBI. A developer of OBI then checks the submitted term and adds it to the OBI. Normally, when the Quick Term is added according the following instructions, this process is semi-automatic.
For a Quick Term to be added quickly to the OBI, it is therefore important to follow the instructions.<br>

Quick ID is created for all who want to add terms to the OBI. The goal of OBI is to create an integrated ontology for the description of life-science and clinical investigations. Anyone involved in the life-sciences or clinical investigations is welcomed to contribute to OBI. The power of OBI is driven by the input of these various fields. The Quick ID process is an expression of this emphasis on open access and development. <br>
Any questions regarding the Quick ID's can be asked ['''here ?mailinglist for Quick ID?''']. 

<br><br>
== BFO, OBI and Quick ID ==

'''In short'''<br><br>
''Quick ID's is a file ''within'' OBI, and OBI uses BFO as an upper ontology. The Quick ID file allows to add terms into OBI, but needs to be curated before being added to the 'core' OBI repository.''
<br><br><br>
'''BFO'''
<br><br>
''The following information is gathered from BFO and is a (very short) summary which hopefully allows to grasp the basics of the BFO. For a full description of Basic Formal ontology (BFO), go to the [http://www.ifomis.org/bfo BFO website]. ''
<br><br>
An ontology tries to '''represent''' the reality and therefore a scientific ontology tries to represent the reality investigated by the sciences. But representing such a reality must be valid across various fields. Constructing specific ontologies only applicable to a specific field is not very useful since it still does not allow to '''integrate''' the data from those fields. BFO is a framework that allows those various fields to be connected using the BFO framework. 
<br><br>
Therefore the BFO is a top-level (or upper or formal) ontology. It's main characteristics are:
<ul>
	<li>top-level<br>
	As mentioned before it is the overall framework designed to integrate domain ontologies.</li>
	<li>Holds categories containing or representing universals primarily<br>
	The goal of BFO is not to develop ontologies as such, but to organize domain ontologies (e.g. an ontology for the neurosciences, the genetic ontology...). Universals are the 'abstract or general' structure (e.g. "human", "mammal" or "feline"). These universals are the focus of BFO and not domain specific terms.</li>
	<li>Uses perspectivalism<br>
	Many different representations that are equally good (good in the sense of being true) precisely in that they capture different and important 
features of one and the same reality </li>
	<li>It's extended downward<br>
	When the BFO will be extended this will be done through its domain ontologies. It is believed that the BFO holds the classes needed for the construction and development of detailed domain ontologies. As such, this framework is thought to be stable and extensive.</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br>
'''OBI'''
<br><br>
The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations project (cf. OBI) is developing an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical investigations. This includes a set of 'universal' terms, that are applicable across various biological and technological domains, and domain-specific terms relevant only to a given domain. This ontology will support the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. The ontology will represent the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type analysis performed on it. In other words: OBI uses the 'framework' of BFO and builds an ontology within this framework which allows to connect data from different fields.
<br><br><br>
'''Quick Terms'''<br><br>
The Quick ID file is a specific file within OBI, which (since being part of the OBI) also uses the BFO. This file is different from other OBI files, due to the fact that all terms initially are 'uncurated'. Though it's part of the OBI, the terms added through Quick ID are not immediately part of the core OBI, but need curation before added to the core OBI. When terms are added correctly this is a semi-automatic process.<br><br>

== Basic Terminology of Quick ID ==


== How is Quick ID's integrated with OBI? ==

= How to submit a term to OBI to get an OBI ID? =

This section explains how to add terms to OBI in order to obtain an OBI ID quickly. As mentioned before, the Quick ID's are created to add terms to OBI ''without'' being deeply involved in the design of OBI. This emphasis on simplifying the process of adding terms is reflected in this section by distinguishing between the actual procedure (=this section) and the theory/concepts behind this procedure (=appendices).

<ul>
	<li>If you simply want to add terms to the ontology, then follow the instructions in this section.</li>
	<li>If you however want to get an idea of the concepts behind this procedure, simply click on the links in the document and you will be guided to a more detailed description of that particular element of the process.</li>
</ul>
If this document is not detailed enough and you would like to see additional information, do not hesitate to contact us! It can only improve this document and hence the entire procedure of the Quick ID.


== Before you start... ==
When you want to add terms through the Quick ID procedure, it is assumed that you:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>You know how to use the specific software to add the terms to OBI. Quick ID (and OBI in general) uses [http://protege.stanford.edu/ Protege], and we recommend that you download and install [http://protege.stanford.edu/download/prerelease/full/ Protege 3.4]</li>
	<li>You have checked out the latest version of the OBI repository using subversion via the command line or via a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients SVN client] from the [https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/ OBI subversion repository] </li>
	<li>Know how to use the Quick ID file locally following [https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/docs/developer/instructions-svn-local.txt these instructions]</li>
	<li>Know how to [http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_10gk2mcpfb use Protege with OBI]. </li>
	<li>Are aware of the [[OBI_Minimal_metadata|OBI Minimal metadata]]</li>
	<li>Are aware of the [http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Naming OBO Foundry naming conventions]. </li> 
</ul>


== Set obi-quick-id.owl as the active ontology file ==

Once selected as active all new classes added to the ontology via Protege will be added to the obi-quick-id.owl file. You can set the obi-quick-id.owl file as the active ontology file following the instructions outlined in section II of the [http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_10gk2mcpfb use Protege with OBI] document.
<br><br>

== Determine the node of the Basic Formal Ontology? ==

OBI uses the [http://www.ifomis.org/bfo Basic Formal Ontology] (BFO) as an upper ontology to provide a framework in support of domain ontologies developed for scientific research. When submitting a term to OBI consideration should be given as to which node of BFO the term should be inferred under. For example, is the term a process, a material entity or information that describes an entity?

The following instructions will help you determine where under BFO your term should go and therefore how to describe and annotate it for inclusion within OBI.

The first step is to determine which BFO class your term should be inferred under. The choices are listed in the table below. Click on the class link to follow the next instructions

==  In the case of a Process ==

If from the BFO definition, you believe your term to be a process then should should describe it in the following manner. Click on the class '''process''' in Protege and click on the add subclass icon and describe the new subclass of process as below. 

A ['''term'''] is a process that ['''description of what the process does'''] and has the input '''[material entity / information'''] and utilizes the function of a ['''material entity/device''']. The output of the process is ['''material entity / information'''].

When adding the terms they must be annotated according to the [[OBI_Minimal_metadata| OBI minimum metadata requirments]] and have the curation status "uncurated". 

For example if you have the term called ['''Dirk insert an example here''']. It could be described in the following way.

A term........['''Dirk to fill in''']

A ['''term'''] is a material entity that ['''description of material''']. 

If appropriate, also add the following:

The ['''term'''] is manufactured by ['''organization or person'''], has function ['''function'''], has supplier ['''organization or person'''].


For example if you have the term called ['''Dirk insert an example here''']. It could be described in the following way.

= Appendices =

These appendices all start with a question. The answer should allow you to understand the procedure of the Quick ID's more. Nevertheless, it's not possible to 'fully' answer all questions, since Quick ID's are part of OBI, which is integrated with BFO. Therefore, the appendices sometimes are mere summaries of the actual answer. These answers are nevertheless rather extensive guides for the questions it tries to address. If so, these appendices refer to documents or URL's containing more information. 

== Appendix A: BFO, OBI and Quick ID ==

'''In short'''<br><br>
''Quick ID's is a file ''within'' OBI, and OBI uses BFO as an upper ontology. The Quick ID file allows to add terms into OBI, but needs to be curated before being added to the 'core' OBI repository.''

The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations project (cf. OBI) is developing an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical investigations.

This ontology will support the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. The ontology will represent the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type analysis performed on it.
