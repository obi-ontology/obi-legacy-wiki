'''About this document'''
<br><br>
This document gives both the rationale and instructions on how to add quick terms to the OBI. A step by step guide should allow anyone to add terms to the OBI, and limited knowledge about the OBI is required. Nevertheless it is strongly recommended to get familiar with ontology design before adding terms to the OBI.<br>
= Introduction to the ''Quick ID''? =

This section is both an introduction as a tutorial for the ''Quick ID'' procedure. The first section is an introduction to the idea behind Quick ID, whereas the second part is the actual tutorial on how to add terms. If you are not familiar with Quick ID's or if this is the first time you add Quick Terms, it is recommended to read through the first section.<br>


== What is a Quick ID? ==
Quick ID's refers to a procedure developed to ''quickly'' add terms to the OBI. The Quick ''ID's'' refer to ID's given to the terms one adds to the OBI repository, where ''quick'' refers to the fast input from the user. Quick ID's therefore refers to the process of quickly adding terms to the OBI, without the necessity of being a ''core'' developer of OBI. It is a process to allow those individuals who might not be strongly involved in the design of OBI, to add terms to the OBI repository. <br>
If we use ''Quick ID's'', we refer to the process of adding terms into the OBI. If we use ''Quick terms' we refer to the actual terms added to the OBI. 


== Why does OBI use Quick ID's? == 
<br>
Quick Id's are created for those who want to contribute/support to the OBI targeting those individuals who are not directly involved or familiar with ontology design. Adding terms through the procedure of Quick ID, allows for fast additions with a minimal learning curve. It's procedure is despite it (relatively) simplicity, nevertheless very powerful. It's combination of curation and openness enables a fast growing ontology created by and for the community.<br><br>
The benefits of the Quick ID procedure for OBI are:
<ul>
	<li>Direct input from the scientific community</li>
	<li>Input from various fields using a single procedure</li>
	<li>Curate the OBI and maintain influx from the community</li>
	<li>Reduced load on curation through expert input</li>
</ul>
Contributors through the Quick ID benefit from:
<ul>
	<li>Small load on contribution</li>
	<li>Hands on control of the OBI</li>
	<li>More robust ontology integration by shared expertise</li>
	<li>Improved speed for the construction and extension of OBI</li>
</ul>


== How are the Quick terms integrated into OBI? ==

Quick Terms hold a special position within OBI. It is fully part of the OBI, however needs to be curated before being submitted to the OBI. This curation process normally has a small load, however allows for the development of a well-structured OBI. 
Initially, a Quick Term has the status of ''uncurated''. This means that these terms are 'on submission' not part of what you could call the core OBI. A developer of OBI then checks the submitted term and adds it to the OBI. Normally, when the Quick Term is added according the following instructions, this process is semi-automatic.
For a Quick Term to be added quickly to the OBI, it is therefore important to follow the instructions. 


== Who can add a Quick Term? ==
Quick ID is created for all who want to add terms to the OBI. The goal of OBI is to create an integrated ontology for the description of life-science and clinical investigations. Anyone involved in the life-sciences or clinical investigations is welcomed to contribute to OBI. The power of OBI is driven by the input of these various fields. The Quick ID process is an expression of this emphasis on open access and development. <br>
Any questions regarding the Quick ID's can be asked ['''here ?mailinglist for Quick ID?'''].

= How to submit a term to OBI to get an OBI ID? =

''This section explains how to add terms to OBI in order to obtain an OBI ID quickly.''


== Before you start... ==
When you want to add terms through the Quick ID procedure, it is assumed that you:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>You know how to use the specific software to add the terms to OBI. Quick ID (and OBI in general) uses [http://protege.stanford.edu/ Protege], and we recommend that you download and install [http://protege.stanford.edu/download/prerelease/full/ Protege 3.4]</li>
	<li>You have checked out the latest version of the OBI repository using subversion via the command line or via a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients SVN client] from the [https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/ OBI subversion repository] </li>
	<li>Know how to use the Quick ID file locally following [https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/docs/developer/instructions-svn-local.txt these instructions]</li>
	<li>Know how to [http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_10gk2mcpfb use Protege with OBI]. </li>
	<li>Are aware of the [[OBI_Minimal_metadata|OBI Minimal metadata]]</li>
	<li>Are aware of the [http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Naming OBO Foundry naming conventions]. </li> 
</ul>


== Set obi-quick-id.owl as the active ontology file ==

Once selected as active all new classes added to the ontology via Protege will be added to the obi-quick-id.owl file.

You can set the obi-quick-id.owl file as the active ontology file following the instructions outlined in section II of the [http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_10gk2mcpfb use Protege with OBI] document.
<br><br>



== Determine the node of the Basic Formal Ontology? ==

OBI uses the [http://www.ifomis.org/bfo Basic Formal Ontology] (BFO) as an upper ontology to provide a framework in support of domain ontologies developed for scientific research. When submitting a term to OBI consideration should be given as to which node of BFO the term should be inferred under. For example, is the term a process, a material entity or information that describes an entity?

The following instructions will help you determine where under BFO your term should go and therefore how to describe and annotate it for inclusion within OBI.

The first step is to determine which BFO class your term should be inferred under. The choices are listed in the table below. Click on the class link to follow the next instructions

Material is any of bfo:Object, bfo:ObjectAggregate, or bfo:FiatObjectPart. 
A bfo:object is a "snap:IndependentContinuant" ("independent_continuant") that is spatially extended, maximally self-connected and self-contained (the parts of a substance are not separated from each other by spatial gaps) and possesses an internal unity. The identity of substantial "snap:Object" ("object") entities is independent of that of other entities and can be maintained through time. A bfo:objectaggregate is a "snap:IndependentContinuant" ("independent_continuant") that is a mereological sum of separate "snap:Object" ("object") entities and possesses non-connected boundaries.
A bfo:faitObjectPart is a "snap:IndependentContinuant" ("independent_continuant") that is part of a "snap:Object" ("object") but is not demarcated by any physical discontinuities.

==  In the case of a Process ==

If from the BFO definition, you believe your term to be a process then should should describe it in the following manner. Click on the class '''process''' in Protege and click on the add subclass icon and describe the new subclass of process as below. 

A ['''term'''] is a process that ['''description of what the process does'''] and has the input '''[material entity / information'''] and utilizes the function of a ['''material entity/device''']. The output of the process is ['''material entity / information'''].

When adding the terms they must be annotated according to the [[OBI_Minimal_metadata| OBI minimum metadata requirments]] and have the curation status "uncurated". 

For example if you have the term called ['''Dirk insert an example here''']. It could be described in the following way.

A term........['''Dirk to fill in''']

== In the case of a Material entity ==

If from the BFO definition, you believe your term to be a material entity then you should describe it in the following manner. Click on the class '''material entity''' in Protege and click on the add subclass icon and describe the new subclass of material entity as below. 

A ['''term'''] is a material entity that ['''description of material''']. 

If appropriate, also add the following:

The ['''term'''] is manufactured by ['''organization or person'''], has function ['''function'''], has supplier ['''organization or person'''].


For example if you have the term called ['''Dirk insert an example here''']. It could be described in the following way.


When adding the terms they must be annotated according to the [[OBI_Minimal_metadata| OBI minimum metadata requirments]] and have the curation status "uncurated".
