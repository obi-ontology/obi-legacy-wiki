We are currently reviewing all of the proposed [[Core|OBI Core]] terms for quality and completeness. This page tracks our progress.

The review of terms is taking place during the [[Conference call developers agenda|weekly developer call]] and on the [[Mailing lists]].

== Completed Terms ==

The following terms have been reviewed, and no further changes are expected:

* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000471 study design execution]
** Will remove "has_specified_output some 'data item'" from equivalent classes. (Keep minimal restrictions that need for defined classes)
** note: Alan asks whether there should be the axiom "has_specified_output some 'data item'" at all. Bjoern insists that there should always be a data item produced. Alan asks about studies that are inconclusive. There is always data collected. The question is whether it is the "specified output" of the study design execution.

== Terms Under Review ==

The following terms are in the process of review, and may require some changes:

* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000066 investigation]
** major: We discussed making the axiom "has_part some documenting" more specific.
*** '''Suggestion 1:''' follow the model of "(planning and (has_specified_output some 'study design'))" <br/>'''Update 2012-09-25'''<br/>This suggestion was dismissed on the developer call 2012/09/17.<br/><br/>
*** '''Suggestion 2:''' We can say things like: investigation that has specified output conclusion equivalentTo: investigation that has part document that has part conclusion textual entity.<br/>'''Update 2012-09-25'''<br/>The current logical definitions of obi:investigation (subClassOf: has_part some iao:documenting) and iao:documenting (subClassOf has_specified_output some iao:document) already entail that one or more iao:document(s) exist as specified outputs of the iao:documenting processes that are part of an obi:investigation. With regard to the [[Investigation#Development_Notes|development notes for the general model]] of an investigation these iao:document(s) might be iao:report(s) (iao:report subClassOf iao:document) but they don't have to be and this is an appropriate view at this level of generality as documenting processes are processes that as a minimal requirement bring results of observations into a tangible, lasting form while reports as outputs of reporting processes put related information content into a much more comprehensive form (to inform a recipient of certain aspects of an investigation). The former can safely be assumed to be part of any investigation while this may be not so clear for the latter. '''In conclusion, what is suggested here is already in place.'''<br/><br/>
*** '''Suggestion 3:''' has_part some 'interpreting data' (or 'drawing conclusion')<br/>'''Update 2012-09-25'''<br/>As a result of our discussion of obi:interpreting_data (see below) we agreed that the axiom obi:investigation subClassOf has_part some obi:drawing a conclusion should be added. James pointed out that based on the current definition an obi:investigation always generates some iao:data_item as specified outputs of the obi:study design execution that is part of the obi:investigation and therefore, as data items are understood to pertain to empirical data, the new axiom could be narrowed down to obi:investigation subClassOf has_part some obi:drawing a conclusion based on data.<br/><br/>
*** '''Action items:'''
**** add axiom obi:investigation subClassOf has_part some obi:drawing a conclusion
** minor: add an objective to produce a conclusion
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000339 planning]
** minor: Add example of usage that has a robot scientist making the plan
** minor: Update the metadata to make clear what "Source PPPB Branch" means. 
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000572 documenting]
** major: Revised definition to improve the grammar: "a planned process in which input information is used to create or add to a document"
** major: Update curation status.
** minor: Add documenting example: Your instrument software prints something and you copy it to a spreadsheet.
** note: Change should be made in iao.owl
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000338 interpreting data]
** major: Rename to 'drawing conclusion' or add 'drawing conclusion' with subclass 'drawing conclusion based on data' and make 'interpreting data' as a subclass of 'drawing conclusion based on data'<br/>'''Note:''' Based on current logical definition, label 'drawing conclusion' is more suitable and it is not limited the inputs as data item. However, 'drawing conclusion' cannot cover 'or to identify what additional data is necessary to draw conclusions' which was addressed in the textual definition.<br/>'''Update 2012-09-25'''<br/>The motivation for reviewing this class is that the current label implies that data items (taken as empirical) are inputs to any such process while the logical definition entails a conclusion as outcome of any such process (which is not in the label). An additional concern is that there may be reasoning processes which do not involve empirical data (e.g. mathematical proofs) As a result of our discussion we concluded that for any process of "interpreting data" the result of that interpretation (whatever it is) amounts to one or more conclusions based on the data being interpreted. Vice versa, any process of drawing a conclusion based on some set of data may be regarded as a process of interpreting that set of data, which makes these classes basically equivalent, though the logical definition would need to be changed. Deprecation or relabelling 'interpreting data' was discussed, currently (2012-09-25) opting for relabelling
*** '''Action items:'''
**** add class obi:drawing a conclusion (subClassOf obi:planned process, subClassOf has_specified_output some iao:conclusion_textual_entity)
**** add label 'drawing a conclusion based on data' as primary label to 'interpreting data'
**** add axiom 'drawing a conclusion based on data' subClassOf has_specified_input some iao:data_item<br/>'''Note:''' As a result this class should be inferred as subclass of the new class 'drawing a conclusion'
