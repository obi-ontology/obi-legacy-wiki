We are currently reviewing all of the proposed [[Core|OBI Core]] terms for quality and completeness. This page tracks our progress.

The review of terms is taking place during the [[Conference call developers agenda|weekly developer call]] and on the [[Mailing lists]].

== Completed Terms ==

The following terms have been reviewed, and no further changes are expected:

* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000471 study design execution]

** Will remove "has_specified_output some 'data item'" from equivalent classes. (Keep minimal restrictions that need for defined classes)

** note: Alan asks whether there should be the axiom "has_specified_output some 'data item'" at all. Bjoern insists that there should always be a data item produced. Alan asks about studies that are inconclusive. There is always data collected. The question is whether it is the "specified output" of the study design execution.

== Terms Under Review ==

The following terms are in the process of review, and may require some changes:

* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000066 investigation]
** major: We discuss making the axiom "has_part some documenting" more specific.
*** suggestion: follow the model of "(planning and (has_specified_output some 'study design'))"
*** suggestion: We can say things like: investigation that has specified output conclusion equivalentTo: investigation that has part document that has part conclusion textual entity
** minor: add an objective to produce a conclusion
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000339 planning]
** minor: Add example of usage that has a robot scientist making the plan
** minor: Update the metadata to make clear what "Source PPPB Branch" means. 
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000572 documenting]
** major: Revised definition to improve the grammar: "a planned process in which input information is used to create or add to a document"
** major: Update curation status.
** minor: Add documenting example: Your instrument software prints something and you copy it to a spreadsheet.
