We are currently reviewing all of the proposed [[Core|OBI Core]] terms for quality and completeness. This page tracks our progress and presents a summary of decisions to get people up to speed quickly. Further discussion notes are included below.

The review of terms is taking place during the [[Conference call developers agenda|weekly developer call]] and on the [[Mailing lists]].

== Terms Under Review ==

The following terms are in the process of review, and may require some changes:

* Remaining OBI terms in the Inner Core, with some preliminary notes by James:
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0600004 human subject enrollment]
*** minor: clarify or remove editor note: "As with group assignment, should the specified output here be an organism which bears a role"
*** major: clarify the use of "population". Is a population of one sufficient? 
*** major: revise output axiom:
**** option: use "Homo Sapiens" for both input and output, rather than "population"
**** option: use "Homo sapiens" rather than population as input, but still maintaining "population" in the specified_output
*** note: this may require review of [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000810 informed consent process]
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000202 investigation agent role]
*** major: consider revising definitions to allow for a "robot scientist" as mentioned for "investigation".
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000453 measure function]
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000260 plan]
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000272 protocol]
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0100051 specimen]
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000659 specimen collection]
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0500000 study design]

== Completed Terms ==

The following terms have been reviewed, changes have been committed, and no further changes are expected during this review:

* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0600008 acquisition]
** note: [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0600010 material acquisition] and [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0600013 information acquisition] will be added to OBI Inner Core, since they are expected to be more widely used than their parent.
** note: We have discussed the potential overlap with "service" terms in OBI. There does not seem to be a problem as terms currently stand, but we can revisit the question in the future as modelling of services matures.
** major: add "SubClass Of: has_specified_output some ('information content entity' or 'material entity')"
** minor: remove alternative label "material acquisition"
** minor: change textual definition to refer to "planned process" rather than "process"
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070 assay]
** major: update textual definition to further distinguish an assay from a prediction: "A planned process with the objective to produce information about the material entity that is the evaluant, by physically examining it or its proxies."
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000785 controlled variable specification]
** added to inner core
** major: change "SubClass Of: 'is part of' some 'plan specification'" to "SubClass Of: 'is part of' some 'study design'"
** major: added example of usage, shared bewteen controlled variable specification, dependent variable specification, and independent variable specification.
** minor: update curation status to "ready for release"
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0200000 data transformation]
** major: make the logical definition more specific than a generic planned process by adding an axiom referring to "algorithm" (a child of "plan specification"): "SubClass of realizes some (concretizes some ('algorithm' and ('has part' some 'objective specification')))" 
** minor: update curation status to "ready for release"
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000751 dependent variable specification]
** major: change "SubClass Of: 'is part of' some 'plan specification'" to "SubClass Of: 'is part of' some 'study design'"
** major: added example of usage, shared bewteen controlled variable specification, dependent variable specification, and independent variable specification.
** minor: update curation status to "ready for release"
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000968 device]
** note: Over the past year we have tried to apply several differentia to distinguish devices from reagents, without much success: a macroscopic/microscopic distinction; requiring that reagents undergo chemical reactions; requiring that devices are not consumed. On the 2012-12-17 developer's call we decided to take a different approach and define "device" as disjoint from "reagent".
** major: modify textual definition "A material entity that is designed to perform a function in a scientific investigation, but is not a reagent."
** major: add "Disjoint With: 'material entity' and ('has role' some 'reagent role')" (this is the logical definition of "reagent" in REO)
** minor: add example of usage for an autoclave
** minor: add editor note explaining the current approach
** minor: remove some of the old editor notes
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000572 documenting]
** major: Revised definition to improve the grammar: "a planned process in which input information is used to create or add to a document"
** minor: Update curation status.
** minor: add example: "Copying the readout from an instrument into a spreadsheet."
** note: no objections to definition change from IAO ([https://groups.google.com/d/topic/information-ontology/JcD4zf8C1aI/discussion email thread])
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0600013 information acquisition]
** major: add "Disjoint With: 'data transformation'"
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000750 independent variable specification]
** major: change "SubClass Of: 'is part of' some 'plan specification'" to "SubClass Of: 'is part of' some 'study design'"
** major: added example of usage, shared bewteen controlled variable specification, dependent variable specification, and independent variable specification.
** minor: update curation status to "ready for release"
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000338 interpreting data] (renamed to "drawing a conclusion based on data")
** major: Add class obi:drawing a conclusion (subClassOf obi:planned process, subClassOf has_specified_output some iao:conclusion_textual_entity)
** major: Add label 'drawing a conclusion based on data' as primary label to 'interpreting data'
** major: Add axiom 'drawing a conclusion based on data' subClassOf has_specified_input some iao:data_item. As a result this class should be inferred as subclass of the new class 'drawing a conclusion'
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000066 investigation]
** major: Add axiom obi:investigation subClassOf has_part some obi:drawing a conclusion
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0600010 material acquisition]
** major: add "Disjoint With: 'material processing'"
** minor: change example from "investigators animal facility" to "bred in the animal facility of the institute as a service to investigators". 
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000339 planning]
** minor: Add example of usage that has a robot scientist making the plan
** minor: Update the metadata to make clear what "Source PPPB Branch" means. 
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000471 study design execution]
** major: remove "has_specified_output some 'data item'" from equivalent classes. (Keep minimal restrictions that need for defined classes)
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000097 study subject role]
** major: rename to "participant under investigation role"
** minor: Add an editor note to say that this role is distinct from "specimen role", but it is possible for a participant to realize both "specimen role" and "participant under investigation role" at the same time.
** minor: Revise examples for style and add another: A lake could realize this role in an investigation that assays pollution levels.
** note: it was decided on the 2012-11-26 call that we should not move the children of this term at this time, but a tracker item has been added flagging the children for later review.

== Discussion Notes ==

* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000471 study design execution]
** note: Alan asks whether there should be the axiom "has_specified_output some 'data item'" at all. Bjoern insists that there should always be a data item produced. Alan asks about studies that are inconclusive. There is always data collected. The question is whether it is the "specified output" of the study design execution.
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000066 investigation]
** major: Add an objective to produce a conclusion. This has not been implemented. On the developer's call 2012-11-16 the consensus was that the objective is implied by "has_part drawing a conclusion". We may decide to specify an objective at a later date.
** major: We discussed making the axiom "has_part some documenting" more specific.
*** '''Suggestion 1:''' follow the model of "(planning and (has_specified_output some 'study design'))" <br/>'''Update 2012-09-25'''<br/>This suggestion was dismissed on the developer call 2012/09/17.<br/><br/>
*** '''Suggestion 2:''' We can say things like: investigation that has specified output conclusion equivalentTo: investigation that has part document that has part conclusion textual entity.<br/>'''Update 2012-09-25'''<br/>The current logical definitions of obi:investigation (subClassOf: has_part some iao:documenting) and iao:documenting (subClassOf has_specified_output some iao:document) already entail that one or more iao:document(s) exist as specified outputs of the iao:documenting processes that are part of an obi:investigation. With regard to the [[Investigation#Development_Notes|development notes for the general model]] of an investigation these iao:document(s) might be iao:report(s) (iao:report subClassOf iao:document) but they don't have to be and this is an appropriate view at this level of generality as documenting processes are processes that as a minimal requirement bring results of observations into a tangible, lasting form while reports as outputs of reporting processes put related information content into a much more comprehensive form (to inform a recipient of certain aspects of an investigation). The former can safely be assumed to be part of any investigation while this may be not so clear for the latter. '''In conclusion, what is suggested here is already in place.'''<br/><br/>
*** '''Suggestion 3:''' has_part some 'interpreting data' (or 'drawing conclusion')<br/>'''Update 2012-09-25'''<br/>As a result of our discussion of obi:interpreting_data (see below) we agreed that the axiom obi:investigation subClassOf has_part some obi:drawing a conclusion should be added. James pointed out that based on the current definition an obi:investigation always generates some iao:data_item as specified outputs of the obi:study design execution that is part of the obi:investigation and therefore, as data items are understood to pertain to empirical data, the new axiom could be narrowed down to obi:investigation subClassOf has_part some obi:drawing a conclusion based on data.<br/><br/>
*** '''Action items:'''
**** add axiom obi:investigation subClassOf has_part some obi:drawing a conclusion '''-DONE-'''
* [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000338 interpreting data]
** major: Rename to 'drawing conclusion' or add 'drawing conclusion' with subclass 'drawing conclusion based on data' and make 'interpreting data' as a subclass of 'drawing conclusion based on data'<br/>'''Note:''' Based on current logical definition, label 'drawing conclusion' is more suitable and it is not limited the inputs as data item. However, 'drawing conclusion' cannot cover 'or to identify what additional data is necessary to draw conclusions' which was addressed in the textual definition.<br/>'''Update 2012-09-25'''<br/>The motivation for reviewing this class is that the current label implies that data items (taken as empirical) are inputs to any such process while the logical definition entails a conclusion as outcome of any such process (which is not in the label). An additional concern is that there may be reasoning processes which do not involve empirical data (e.g. mathematical proofs) As a result of our discussion we concluded that for any process of "interpreting data" the result of that interpretation (whatever it is) amounts to one or more conclusions based on the data being interpreted. Vice versa, any process of drawing a conclusion based on some set of data may be regarded as a process of interpreting that set of data, which makes these classes basically equivalent, though the logical definition would need to be changed. Deprecation or relabelling 'interpreting data' was discussed, currently (2012-09-25) opting for relabelling
*** '''Action items:'''
**** add class obi:drawing a conclusion (subClassOf obi:planned process, subClassOf has_specified_output some iao:conclusion_textual_entity)
**** add label 'drawing a conclusion based on data' as primary label to 'interpreting data'
**** add axiom 'drawing a conclusion based on data' subClassOf has_specified_input some iao:data_item<br/>'''Note:''' As a result this class should be inferred as subclass of the new class 'drawing a conclusion'
* Modelling "possession" or "contol" over resources:
** note: It would be useful to be able to model "possession" and "control", which are important parts of the textual definition of "acquisition". But in the 2013-01-07 call we decided that this is not an urgent need, and have left it for later.
** [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0600008 acquisition]
*** note: We want to be able to model "possession" or "control" of material entities (and probably information content entities), which will probably require new roles. These roles were proposed in the context of "material acquisition" but we should consider generalizing them to "resources" that could be material or information:
*** major: add 'material possessor role' = borne by person or organization, realized in choices about what to do with material (this would be for other people to refine to determine kinds of ownership)
*** major: add 'material acquisition source role' = a role borne by a person or organization that is realized in an material acquisition process in which a material possessor role is transferred from the material acquisition source to the material acquisition destination  (it gets difficult to write this nicely with multiple role and bearer relationships...)
