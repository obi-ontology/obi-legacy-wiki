<h3>Design Template for Assays:</h3>

OBI is designed around assays which includes processes, specifications, inputs, and outputs. An example of an assay is provided in the Quick Terms Template paper (Rocca-Serra et al., Overcoming the Ontology Enrichment Bottleneck with Quick Term Templates, ICBO, BUffalo, NY, July , 2009).

<b>Analyte assays:</b> An analyte assay is an assay with
the objective to determine concentration of one
substance (bearer of analyte role) that is present in
(part of) another (bearer of the evaluant role). The
output of the assay is information about concentration
â€“ a relational quality of the analyte towards the
evaluant.
