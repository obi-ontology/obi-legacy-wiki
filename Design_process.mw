<h3>Design Template for Assays:</h3>

OBI is designed around assays which includes processes, specifications, inputs, and outputs. An example of an assay is provided in the Quick Terms Template paper (Rocca-Serra et al., Overcoming the Ontology Enrichment Bottleneck with Quick Term Templates, ICBO, BUffalo, NY, July , 2009).

<b>Analyte assays:</b> An analyte assay is an assay with
the objective to determine concentration of one
substance (bearer of analyte role) that is present in
(part of) another (bearer of the evaluant role). The
output of the assay is information about concentration
– a relational quality of the analyte towards the
evaluant.<br>

Logical definition:<br>
(‘achieves planned objective’ some ‘analyte measurement
objective’<br>
and realizes some ('evaluant role' that ‘inheres in’ some
‘material entity’)<br>
and realizes some ('analyte role' that ‘inheres in’ some
'scattered molecular aggregate')<br>
and has_specified_output_information some ('scalar
measurement datum' and ('is quality measurement of' some
'molecular concentration') and ('has measurement unit
label' some concentration unit label'))

<b>Sequencing assays:</b> the use of a chemical or biochemical means to infer the sequence of a biomaterial
