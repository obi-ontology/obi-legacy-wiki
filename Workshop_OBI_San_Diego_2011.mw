'''Schedule'''

Morning sessions will be 9-12, afternoon 1-5

''Monday morning''  

Introductory session
 - Bjoern (OBI overview and IEDB)
 - Jie  (EuPathDB)
 - Carlo
 - Marcos
 - Jessica
 - Philippe
 - Chris (manuscript + state of OBI)

''Monday afternoon'' 

 - Services (Carlo)
    - Finalize the discussion we started in Vancouver last year.
    - Discuss design pattern and examples in OBI to discuss (is service a subclass of the related planned process offered as service?) 
    '''- Result: Carlo and Matt to write up modeling and circulate'''


  - Reagents (Carlo) 
    - brief presentation of the work done since the Vancouver workshop
    '''- Result: Submit those material entities to OBI that are in scope (processed materials used as reagents)'''


 - Shortcut Relations (Carlo)
   - Start with example from services (e.g. organization X 'offers service' Y)
   - Participants should provide additional use cases / examples 
   '''- Result: Go ahead with implementation of 'service provided by' as a shortcut; (similar to achieves_objective), Use domain / Range approach to have minimal inference already.''' 


''Tuesday morning''
 - Genotype (Jie/Chris) 
  - Discuss definition of genotype, allele, wildtype as needed for OBI 
  '''- Result: Jie and Chris to move relevant classes and definitions from ExpDesign.owl into obi.owl. Produce a writeup and circulate. Further discussion required for 'genetic material''''. 

''Tuesday afternoon''
 - Experimental Design for functional genomics (Chris/Jie)
   - complete to meet requirements by Jie
  '''- Result: Writeup produced, and circulated to Philippe for comment. Afterwards, circulate to all. Go ahead with implementation of study designs via MappingMaster."'''

 - Epitope assay needs for IEDB (Bjoern) 
   - presentation of assay solution
   - discuss impact on assay vs. study design
   '''- Result: Allow complex assays, meaning all IEDB needs are met. '''

''Monday night (potential reschedule to Tuesday because of weather)''
 - BBQ - Villa Peters (622 Colima Street, La Jolla)
   '''- Result: fat and happy with German and butter'''

''Wednesday morning''
 - Community views 
   - FGED view (Chris / Jie)
   - IEDB view (Bjoern) 
   - OBI slim for general use
   '''- Result: Email circulated'''

''Wednesday afternoon''
 - OBI business + coordination (Bjoern)
   - Manuscript completion '''Result:Email circulated. Input for new use cases by April 15.'''
   - discussion of challenges of software that uses OBI, how to develop it, examples? '''Result: Need to have higher frequency of releases.''' 

   - OBI maintenance needs + processes (release, documentation, webpage, track citations)
   - Approaches to obtain funding
   - preparation for ICBO workshop
