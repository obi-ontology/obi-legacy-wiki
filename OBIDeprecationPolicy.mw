==OBI Release Process ==

[http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_20cdv87mdw - google doc ]

At release the OBI files have QC run and an inferred hierarchy produced. Each release is versioned, and is available from a specific URI using the release date as a tag. The current release is available from the download link - right.

The most up-to-date stable release file is available from 

* SVN
* Bioportal
* OBO repository

Pre-release files need to be checked out from SVN - see

==OBI QC==

Checks are made prior to release to assure compliance of the released version with OBI policies.

Specifically, classes are identified that do not comply with the minimal metadata policy, have invalid OWL syntax or lead to inconsistency when reasoning using Pellet (Evren Sirin 2007) or Fact++[ http://owl.man.ac.uk/factplusplus/]. Identifier format and policies are also enforced.  “New classes are automatically assigned a permanent identifier in the format OBI_0000001” on their first release. Similarly, the release process verifies that all IDs that were present in the previous release are still in use. This conforms with the GO deprecation policy that OBI has adopted.

==OBI Deprecation Policy==

Deleted classes are moved under the ObsoleteClass in the OBI hierarchy and stored in a separate file. Identifiers are not re-used so classes can be tracked.

==Needs clarification==

After release or for RC1.0 will the following mean that a class is deprecated:

If RDFS labels are changed?

If there are axiomatic changes? E.g. new necessary and sufficient conditions

If there are new asserted parents - ie a class is moved

If text definitions are changed?

If a MIREOT term is obsoleted

==Consequences for users==

==Release notes and changelogs==

Each OBI commit into SVN has a change log. On release these are provided as release notes. 

Each released version of OBI *should have*  release notes indicating major changes, e.g. new terms imported from an external ontology, or reasons for deprecation
