==OBI Release Process ==

[http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dzprnmw_20cdv87mdw - Google Doc Discussing Deprecation ]

At release the OBI files have QC run and an inferred hierarchy produced. Each release is versioned, and is available from a specific URI using the release date as a tag. The current release is available from the download link - right.

The most up-to-date stable release file is available from

==OBI QC==

Checks are made prior to release to assure compliance of the released version with OBI policies.

Specifically, classes are identified that do not comply with the minimal metadata policy, have invalid OWL syntax or lead to inconsistency when reasoning using Pellet (Evren Sirin 2007) or Fact++[ http://owl.man.ac.uk/factplusplus/]. Identifier format and policies are also enforced.  “New classes are automatically assigned a permanent identifier in the format OBI_0000001” on their first release. Similarly, the release process verifies that all IDs that were present in the previous release are still in use. This conforms with the GO deprecation policy that OBI has adopted.

==OBI Deprecation Policy==

OBI terms occasionally have errors and need to be retired. The process of retiring a term is called obsolete or deprecating it. 

We consider the terms to be equivalent in this context and our intention is that the term no longer be used in new annotation, and that annotations that use it be revised to use a more correct term.  

Prior to deprecation:

*Editors will note to relevant discussion groups, including our user mailing lists, soliciting opinions. Once the decision to deprecate has been made:

*Editor note will be added to the OWL file explaining or pointing to a discussion of the reason why the term is being deprecated, and, if available, a suggestion of more appropriate terms to use'  '''If editor notes are removed from the OWL file at release this won't work HP.'''
'
Class "obsolescence reason specification" similar to the curation status specification is also used. Allowed values are term imported, term split, placeholder removed, terms merged, failed exploratory term, other.
'''
MC: wrt to editor notes, I think it is very important to point to replacement or have explanation of deprecation. If we vote for removal of editor notes maybe we should skip obsolete classes? Other option is create a distinct annotation property, maybe "replaced by", or use seeAlso (which I like less as less precise)'''

*Deleted classes are moved under the ObsoleteClass in the OBI hierarchy and stored in a separate file. Identifiers are not re-used so classes can be tracked.

*A deprecated annotation property is applied '''still true?'''

Outstanding AI from Google doc:

*Modify reporting script to report obsolete classes or properties that are not in Obsolete.owl, or which are not a subclass of only ObsoleteClass or ObsoleteProperty. No other warnings or errors will be issued for obsolete terms. '''HP: done?'''


*Implement scripts to find obsolete classes by either: deprecatedClass/deprecatedProperty, "obsolete" curation status, or being a subclass (direct or inferred) of ObsoleteClass or ObsoleteProperty. Update all such cases to remove axioms other than the single subclassOf, to update the curation status, and, optionally, to mark as owl:deprecated.'''HP: done?  '''MC: no''

== Allowed changes ==

*If RDFS labels may change e.g. to correct typos, or make a label clearer

*Axiomatic changes may be made, ie restrictions added or removed resulting in a change in heirarchy on classification

*Classes may be moved, ie asserted parents may be removed or added

*If text definitions and annotation properties may be added or removed

*Some terms are imported from external ontologies - if these are obsolete in the source ontology you may still find these in OBI, please report these.

==Consequences for users==

*Classes, properties and instances are deprecated when their 'meaning' in OBI changes or the class is found to be redundant. Any logical definitions which use that term will be modified so that references are removed.

 *If a term in OBI was found to be present in an OBO foundry ontology the original OBI term may be deprecated and replaced with  an imported term

 *If a term in OBI is decided to be out of scope, badly defined, or redundant it will be deprecated, prefixed with obsolete and given a new parent 'ObsoleteClass' obsolete_digital_entity, reason for deprecation='failed exploratory term'

==Release notes and changelogs==

Each OBI commit into SVN has a change log. On release these are provided as release notes. 

Each released version of OBI *should have*  release notes indicating major changes, e.g. new terms imported from an external ontology, or reasons for deprecation
