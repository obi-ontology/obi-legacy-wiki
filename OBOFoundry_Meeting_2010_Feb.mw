==OBI requests for Foundry==

* status of BFO2 and relations. Will there be a public call for comments on a draft version, and if yes any date estimate? Related, status of OBI relations submitted to RO.
* It is sometimes problematic to integrate with other resources that don't fall under BFO - is there any plan to help to increase adoption rate?
* any progress on inter-species anatomy, and/or any way we could help?

* the problem we met when we try to import SO terms to OBI, such as SO term, genotype (not sure whether it is in OBO scope)
