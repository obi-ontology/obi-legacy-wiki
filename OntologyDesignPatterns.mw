==Ontology Normalization and Single Inheritance==

Fundemental to how we use OWL and leverage the tools specifically designed for use both to curate and process OWL ontologies (e.g., DIG reasoners such as Pellet and FaCT++) is the way in which we create ObjectProperties to construct more various class relations, as opposed to asserting multiple hierarchies via the owl:SubclassOf class axiom.  This is a critical issue both in helping to guide the choices we make within a branch as to what defining properties should be used to build the single asserted subsumptive (i.e., 'is_a') hierarchy, as well as how to relate classes across branches using ObjectProperty restrictions.
