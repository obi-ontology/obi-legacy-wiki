==UML group==

A UML group has been constituted to help modeling the use cases. Please add your name below if you wish to contribute. I tentatively split the contributions into 2 groups:

1. active developers<br>
This group is the one actively involved in doing the work. Members are in charge of managing creation/update/release of the UML diagrams.

2. reviewers<br>
This group is involved in reviewing the UML diagrams, and its members act as "observers" to help check on the diagrams before release.
