!! Policy for adding a term into OBI

a new term into OBI and would like to be discussed on today's dev call.

To add a new term into OBI, please provide minimal required metadata of the term if possible, which are
- Definition
- Definition Source
- Definition Editor
- Editor Preferred Term
- Curation status

* '''Definition''': should follow OBO foundry principle (http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/OBO_Foundry_Principles):
  the genus-species form: An A =def. a B which Cs, where B is the parent of the defined term A and C is the defining characteristic of those Bs which are also As. 
For example, the textual definition of OBI_'container' (a subclass of device) is:
  A device that can be used to restrict the location of material entities over time.
For a defined class, which could have more than one parent class after reasoning. The definition is not necessary to begin with its direct superclass. It can start with 'a material entity' (subclass of '_defined_material') or 'a processual_entity' (subclass of '_defined processes'). For example, the textual definition of OBI_'specimen' (a subclass of _defined_material) is:
  A material entity that has the specimen role.


'Definition Editor' could be person or group. If editor is a person, start with 'PERSON:' followed by person's name. If editor is
a group, start with 'GROUP:'. Examples:
	PERSON:Bjoern Peters
	GROUP:OBI group

Question: PERSON/GROUP, should be capital case or doesn't matter?

Question about multiple editors: create Definition Editor annotation for each person, or using comma separate different persons in one
Definition Editor annotation, or doesn't matter. For example,
	editor - PERSON:Bjoern Peters,Helen Parkinson or
	editor - PERSON:Bjoern Peters
	editor - PERSON:Helen Parkinson

'Definition Source' could be person(s), group, website, external ontology, ISBN, PUBMED ID, DOI, etc. Examples:
	PERSON:Chris Stoeckert
	GROUP:OBI group
	WEB:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray
	MO_697 arrayer

'Editor Preferred Term' should be same as the term label

Commonly used curation status when adding a new term:
	uncurated: nothing except label
	metadata incomplete: not all required metadata are provided or the editor still works on the provided minimal metadata. (should be more than label provided)
	metadata complete: all required metadata have been provided
	
For OBI release, no term should be at 'uncurated' status.
