==Foundational semantic framework for material objects (biomaterial and instrument branches)==

Initial efforts to organize the root of the material branches ('''Biomaterial''' and '''Instrument''') led to the creation of a base class '''artifact_object''' intended as a means of separating biologically-based objects ('''immortal_cell''', '''ChEBI_object''', '''xenograft''', etc.) from non-biological physical materials artificially ''shaped through human craft'' (e.g., '''Instruments''', '''Cardinal_part_of_instrument''', etc.).

Further review by the larger group of OBI developers that took place during the [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Bethesda2007Workshop bi-annual OBI Developer meeting in July 2007 at the NIH in Bethesda, MD] led to two fundamental questions:
# It appears quite difficult to consistently define the boundary between ''biological'' and ''artificial'' materials.  The existence of classes under '''Biomaterial''' such as '''ExperimentalBiomaterialEntity''' and '''NaturalBiomaterialEntity''' seem to highten as opposed to resolve the issue by drawing attention to the arbitrary and potentially inconsistent boundary between ''natural'' and ''artificial'' biologically-derived material.
# Whether or not the boundary is considered arbitrary, the question remains as to what the primary classification for material objects should be.  The discussion has focussed on:
#* whether and/or how to use the ontology normalization Design Pattern to define the core hierarchy with alternative hierarchies defined via inference?
#* if normalization is to be used, how and which ObjectProperties and Qualities will be required to support inferring all the needed classification hierarchies?
#* if normalization is to be used, will we want to deploy a version of OBI where inferred classification hierarchies are saved as asserted classes for the convenience of the community of OBI users?

* Discussion (heavily edited)
** from OBI Bethesda Meeting - ''July 10''
*** '''BB''': I don't understand why we need artefact objects
*** '''HP''': Didn't we decide on phone call to remove artefact. 
*** '''BB''': Get rid of artefact
** ''July 11, 2007 4:37:17 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': This class is here to have a separation from biomaterial. It is not just a parent class for instruments. We have spent alot of time producing these classes, we did not just include them on a whim. The class is there to provide a holder for man-made object such as polyacrylamide gels, which are not instruments not labware and not biomaterials but are objects.
** ''July 11, 2007 4:55:49 AM EDT''
*** '''AR''': The definition didn't seem to work as intended. Domesticated animals are shaped by human craft, as are transgenic mice, yet these were also considered to be Biomaterials.
*** '''AR''': What inferential power will the superclass have - if you know something is an artefact_object then how can use that piece of information for profit?
** ''July 11, 2007 5:14:34 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': Would a better response not have been, "lets work on the defintion of both biomaterial and artefact_object", rather than, "lets delete it"?
**** '''AR''': Perhaps - '''IF''' we can justify the value of doing so. There's a lot to be done and one must prioritize. Nothing is permanent, or closed for discussion. If you think this should be kept open and want to try to work on a better definition, then let's.  But do give a little more thought about whether it is worth the effort and perhaps defend that it is a bit.
*** '''FG''': (Yes), the definition of Biomaterial needs more clarification, if we are to define its disjoints. I would definitely agree biomaterial captures context specific information. Where would nucleic acids and amino acids go in the hierarchy?  Are they a '''biomaterial''' or are they what '''''defines''''' a biomaterial?
**** '''AR''': Yup
** ''July 11, 2007 5:29:20 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': aretfact_object was developed as a disjoint to biomaterial. If biomaterial is deleted or re-worked, then likewise artefact_object may follow or cease to be an issue.
** ''July 11, 2007 6:24:11 AM EDT''
*** '''AL''': As AR said, there's room for more discussion later on if necessary. The consensus of the group when I presented (in addition to what AR & BB say above), was that the children of artefact_object could just as easily be moved up to be disjoint siblings of biomaterial, rather than having artefact_object be disjoint.
**** '''FG''': I disagree,  However, this is dependent on what Biomaterial is meant to capture - if it should exist at all. Clearly, the definition of '''Biomaterial''' requires more work before determining if its disjoints are correct. 
** ''July 11, 2007 6:24:15 AM EDT''
*** '''BB''': Out of necessity, HP sought to capture the consensus in the minutes.  The exchange you excerpted does give the impression this change was made very quickly and my resolving comment appears flippant.  Neither was the case.  During the lengthy discussion, several of us came to agreement that - as Alan summarized it - there needs to be a sufficiently clear and consistent boundary for class distinction to be ''useful''.  To state it in the inverse, '''''IF''''' there is an important and useful distinction to be made, then the definitions (and/or axioms/restrictions) must be specified to support algorithmically recognizing that distinction (through asserted or inferred entailments).  The specification of human manipulation/craft as a means to distinguish ALL artefact_objects from Biomaterial_objects is not sufficiently clear, consistent, and scalable.  Though nearly all of us appeared to have an implicit sense this distinction was important, we struggled with how best to make this distinction explicit so as to avoid inconsistent statements when applied to all sub-classes and instances of '''Biomaterial''' and '''artifact_object''' under consideration.
** ''July 11, 2007 12:18:51 PM EDT''
*** '''BB''': Some Bethesda meeting discussions implied (for aesthetics and other reasons related to ontology development ''best practices'') we may also need to include the representational requirements of users outside the purview of what we as a group might ''obviously'' identify as core users of OBI.  This came up in the discussion of the '''Biomaterial''' class '''whole_mount'''.
** ''Tuesday, July 17, 2007 12:52 PM EDT''
*** '''FG''': Summary of dangling issues
***# My feeling is '''Biomaterial''' and '''artefact_object''' must exist together. If one goes they both go.
***# '''Biomaterial''' is confusing and appears to be based on the origin and the characteristics of the object as opposed to the ''is_a'' hierarchy.  Considering that fact, the best parent term for everything presently under '''Biomaterial''' ''may'' be '''bfo:object'''. 
***# AAs:
***## Determine and '''''clearly''''' specify what we mean by biological?
***## Classify things into an ''is_a'' hierarchy with structure-based foundational, '''Biomaterial''' classes - e.g., '''chemical''', '''amino_acid''', '''protein''', '''cell''', '''organism'''
***## Identify and classify collections/aggregates/groups of these such as '''cell-line''', '''population''', '''pellet''', '''lysate''', '''compound_liquid (growth media, buffers etc)'''
***# Unresolved questions:
***## '''Biomaterial''' is defined as ''an object of biological origin''.
***##* '''''Question''''': What is ''biological origin''?
***## '''chimera''':
***##* '''''Statement''''': A '''chimera''' is not a '''Biomaterial''', rather it is a description of the genetic composition of a '''Biomaterial'''. Generally, a chimeric '''organism''' is artificially produced by physically mixing cells from two genetically close yet distinct '''organism'''s
***##* '''''Question''''': Given that assertion, is a '''chimera''' ''synthetic''?
***## '''ExperimentalBiomaterial''':
***##* '''''Question''''': No definition - what is this?
***## '''GeneticinformatContent''':
***##* '''''Statement''''': No definition - Taking the meaning of the class name literally, this is not an '''bfo:object''' - let alone a '''Biomaterial'''
***## '''NaturalBiomaterialEntity''':
***##* '''''Question''''': No definition - what is an '''UnnaturalBiomaterialEntity'''?
***## '''cell_derived_from_multicellular_organism''' and  '''NaturalBiomaterialEntity''' are both immediate children of '''Biomaterial'''.  '''Cell''' is an immediate child of '''NaturalBiomaterialEntity'''
***##* '''Cell''' ''definition'': "The smallest structural unit of living organisms that is able to grow and reproduce independently."
***##* '''cell_derived_from_multicellular_organism''' ''definition'': "A cell derived from a multicellular organism."
***##* '''''Question''''': What distinction between these two cell types justifies them being placed in the ''is_a'' hierarchy the way the are?
***##* '''''Question''''': How can their corresponding and inherent ''cell-ness'' be asserted in the ontology given this placement in the hierarchy?
***## '''biosource_provider''' is an immediate child of '''Biomaterial'''
***##* '''''Question''''': Why?
***## '''differentiation_state''' and '''organism_status''' are immediate children of '''Biomaterial'''
***##* '''differentiation_state''' ''definition'': "The differentiation_state is a descriptor of a cell's properties at some defined point in the differentiation process recognisable by some observable characteristic such as morphology."
***##* '''organism_status''' ''definition'': "Organism_status is the stage premortem or postmortem at which the sample was processed for extraction of biomaterials."
***##* '''''Statement''''': These are both types of '''Quality''', not types of '''Biomaterial'''
***## '''molecular_mixture''' is an immediate child of '''Biomaterial'''
***##* '''molecular_mixture''' ''definition'': "A molecular mixture is an unspecified collection of heterogeneous molecules, e.g. lipids, carbohydrate , nucleic acids and proteins"
***##* '''''Question''''': Isn't this a '''bfo:object_aggregate'''?
***## '''entity_of_organism_orgin''' is an immediate child of '''Biomaterial'''
***##* '''entity_of_organism_orgin''' ''definition'': "An entity of organismal origin is a biomaterial entity which is obtained from an organism. definition_source: OBI."
***##* '''''Statement''''': This does not make sense to me, and I do not think the children will allow it to be consistent with the reasoner.
***## '''Chebi_object''' is an immediate child of '''Biomaterial'''
***##* '''entity_of_organism_orgin''' ''definition'': "objects of chemical or biological interest."
***##* '''''Statement''''': ChEBI entities are chemicals, not '''Biomaterial''' - e.g., '''acrylamide''' (CHEBI:28619), '''Triton X-100''', '''chromium_51'''
***## There are two separate '''virus''' classes as immediate children of '''Organism'''
***##* '''virus''' I ''definition'': "Organism with a nucleic acid genome that must replicate in a living cell, as they cannot carry out metabolic processes on their own." (definition_editor: Maura Gasparetto)
***##* '''virus''' II ''definition'': "A virus is an organism that infects cells in biological organisms. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites; they can reproduce only by invading and taking over other cells as they lack the cellular machinery for self reproduction." (definition_source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus)
***##* '''''Question''''': Mistake?
** ''July 17, 2007 3:12:23 PM EDT''
*** '''BP''': Most of the issues you enumerate above are unfortunate leftovers from previous obi.owl versions. They should not be in the file at all, and we will remove them quickly.
*** '''BP''': Regarding the separation of artifact vs. biomaterial, I wholeheartedly agree the current state is not good. Your suggestions are in line with discussions we had at the workshop.  These discussions were aborted to allow for more time to think about the issues.  Below is how '''''I''''' would like to do things (=this is not consensus). 
**** Object (by its physical structure)
***** Countable Object
****** Atom
****** Molecule (=Chebi Object)
****** MultiMolecule
***** Portion of Matter (The portion of… comes from Barry)
****** Portion of Liquid Matter
****** Portion of Gaseous Matter
**** Object (by its function)
***** Instrument
***** Organism
***** Reagent
**** Object (by how it was generated)
***** Manufactured artifact
***** Environmental sample
***** Organism sample
*** '''BP''': The main point is to create separate hierarchies for objects along different axis.  The three top level classes are not distinct, i.e. a phosphate buffer solution is a portion of liquid matter AND a reagent AND a manufactured artifact.
*** '''BP''': Of course these are just skeleton trees. I am hoping in the next biomaterial call we can discuss this and alternative solutions.
** ''July 17, 2007 5:27:12 PM EDT''
*** '''FG''': When it would be useful to talk about an object based on its function or by how it was generated/collected, object_by_function and object_by_collection should be inferred by the reasoner based on the knowledge assigned to each object; therefore, something like these two ''defined'' classes based on ObjectProperty restrictions. 
*** '''FG''': As for object by counting or object by portion, I am not convinced this is the correct separation. 
*** '''FG''': So carrying on in the spirit of suggesting hierarchy; I am going to see if objects can separated based on matter.  Hopefully, nobody starts talking about phases of matter :) 
**** BFO_object
***** solid matter
****** atom
****** molecule
****** multimolecule
****** organism
****** device
***** liquid matter
***** gas matter
*** '''FG''': For example, a solution used in an investigation would be an object_aggregate defined as follows:
**** "A solution is a compound liquid which is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, which may be solids, liquids, gases, or a combination of these."
** ''July 17, 2007 6:02:46 PM EDT''
*** '''BP''': The separation between ''portion'' and ''countable'' is supposed to be between ''mass terms'' (objects that can be divided into two smaller portions of the same type) and ''countable terms'' (like atom, molecule), of which a single instance cannot be divided in two without changing it.  
*** '''BP''': Solid, liquid, gaseous, solution, gel etc. are phases of matter (sorry), i.e. statistical descriptions of the behavior of large collections of particles with emergent properties (like fluidity, pressure). In this sense, atoms, molecules or organisms are not solid matter. I assume you wanted ''solid matter'' to mean something like ''has a defined boundary'', which is pretty much what I meant by ''countable'', so I hope we can easily reach agreement on this.
** ''July 17, 2007 6:07:05 PM EDT''
*** '''BB''': I would agree with Frank's general point above - when we see a multiple hierarchy showing up, we should review how we'd use modularization and other ontology design patterns to infer those categories, as opposed to enshrining them in the asserted subsumptive hierarchy.
**** '''BP''': The ''object by its function'' category was meant to be asserted (by function). The ''object by generating process'' hierarchy was meant to be asserted (by the process the object is an output from). The reason to display them in the hierarchy was that at the workshop concerns were raised that the hierarchy by physical structure does not reflect how our primary users want to have objects displayed.
** ''July 18, 2007 12:46:54 AM EDT''
*** '''BB''': Bjoern and Frank are converging on a workable solution to this issue.  I still believe we need to address:
***# We should be clear about what is to be at the core of the asserted (as opposed to inferred) ontology graph and the variety of artifacts we will distribute to the wider public.  In the latter category, there will be:
***## ''fully asserted views'' = inferred classes which we save as asserted classes for the purposes of providing the variety of classifications the user community will need.  This ''view' will likely have multiple asserted hierarchies.  This was a point I was trying to make (not very well, I'm afraid) in the OBI Function branch presentation in Bethesda.  Alan was making this point more directly Monday & Teusday - the use of normalization and publishing multiple ''views'' of OBI that are derived via inference.
***## ''lexical views'' derived by adjusting the ''prefLabel'' for classes based on a the particular needs of a specific community
***# '''mass entities''' vs. '''countable entities''' - I would like to know how these relate to the BFO classes object and object_aggregate.  I've been through this a few times in reviewing BFO and think I understand ***#* '''bfo:object'''
***#** ''rdfs:label'': object
***#** ''synonyms'': substance
***#** ''definition'': A independent continuant that is spatially extended, maximally self-connected and self-contained (the parts of a substance are not separated from each other by spatial gaps) and possesses an internal unity. The identity of substantial objects is independent of that of other entities and can be maintained through time and through loss and gain of parts and qualities.
***#** ''examples'': an organism, a heart, a chair, a lung, an apple
***#* '''bfo:object_aggregate'''
***#** ''rdfs:label'': object_aggregate
***#** ''synonyms'': substance aggregate
***#** ''definition'': An independent continuant that is a mereological sum of separate objects and possesses non-connected boundaries.
***#** ''examples'': a heap of stones, a group of commuters on the subway, a collection of random bacteria, a flock of geese, the patients in a hospital
***# the whole vs. the parts
***#* '''bfo:object''' expressly addresses this issue of distinct entities (i.e., "maximally self-connected and self-contained).
***#* Though I don't believe this maps to the current expected use of these BFO classes, ages ago, ontologists came up with the notion of an object_aggregate to provide a means of referring to entities that are composed of countable parts - e.g., armies, flocks of birds, etc.. 
***#* If we want to represent the distinct entities of which a solution such as PBS is composed, then we need to describe a solution as an object aggregate which is composed_of a bulk solvent (for PBS - of type '''chebi:water''') and a collection of solutes (for PBS '''chebi:phosphate ion''', '''chebi:magnesium''', '''chebi:calcium''' - at a minimum), along with other quantified values such as the PO4, Mg, and Ca++ concentration. We could then refer to an instance of the object_aggregate PBS with other specified pato:qualities such as pato:liquid_configuration (one can freeze aliquots of PBS), along with certain quantified values such as pH, temperature, etc.
***# Phases of matter
***#* There are many formal mathematical descriptions of phases and phase transitions.  Which one you pick may depend on the requirements in your field and your particular application.  Both thermo and stat mech provide distinct (yet commensurate) formal descriptions.  You might pick one or the other representation, depending on what you require of your description.
***#* I may be wrong here, but I'm hoping in OBI, we will be able to get away with using pato:qualities (see below). If - as Chris mentioned - some physical chemists are not happy with the way phases of matter are represented in PATO, we should review the ontology use case they feel will not be satisfied by this representation, and see if we can work with Chris to adjust PATO to fit this need.



==Separating Objects and ObjectAggregates==
* Discussion (heavily edited)
** ''July 11, 2007 6:24:15 AM EDT''
*** '''BB''': Re: the '''artefact_object''' examples (see above) - There is a mix of objects (filter paper, parafilm) and object_aggregates (gel matrix, buffer solution).  My classification here may appear to be based on an arbitrary definition of granularity.  Rather, given OBI's particular application requirements - capturing distinctions critical to the complete representation of an investigation - filter paper and parafilm parts will likely not be needed , whereas the composition of a buffer and --probably-- a gel matrix are details likely relevant to either evaluating, interpreting, or reproducing investigations where those entities play a critical role.  There may be some contexts where a few buffer global qualities (e.g., pH, temperature, etc.) will suffice, but there will also be times when solution composition will be critical to the protocol_application.
** ''July 11, 2007 7:49:09 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': To add confusion to the issue, a gel matrix is only an object aggregate if it is composed form other objects. If you buy a pre-made and cast gel matrix from a vendor does it cease to be an object aggregate?
**** '''BB''': In an experiment where that is the case, then one need not capture the process used to manufacture the gel - however, just to describe it as investigational tool, you may still require capturing some of its composite elements (e.g., 10% TBE gels).  It ''might'' be expedient and appropriate to simply capture this as a global quality of the gel object.  However, if there's a need to capture the way in which the sample or reagents interact with or are affected by the components of the TBE buffer (i.e., Tris, Borate, and EDTA) when interpreting the results of the investigation, then it may be necessary to at least break out the gel matrix from the buffer.  When the gel is manufactured in the lab, sometimes it will be relevant to capture the amount of Ammonium Persulfate and TEMED used to polymerize the matrix based on what biomaterial sample is being separated and how quickly the gel needs to be used.
**** '''AR''': To describe the constitution of a composite entity, one must describe its composite parts regardless of the process of used to put it together. If it's an object aggregate when you put it together, then it's an object aggregate if someone else puts it together.  
**** '''AR''': That said, we did discuss that the whole object aggregate versus object distinction is unclear. Barry believes it can be disambiguated, but - at a minimum - he's not unconfused me yet.
***** '''CC''': If I remember (some of) Barry's arguments correctly, aesthetics and symmetry seemed to play an important part: whence we have person and population (as an agregate of persons), why not have the same situation at the object and process level?
** ''July 11, 2007 9:15:34 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': As to granualirty - where do we draw the line? If we are describing molecules and chemicals as objects, then anything composed of these "atomic parts" (to use the word loosely) is an aggregate_object?
*** '''FG''': Who benefits from having an aggregate class anyway?
*** '''FG''': I'm not intending to start a controversy, but maybe we could do the same as Protocol vs ProtocolApplication, and say everything is an object for now, rather than an aggregate.
** ''July 11, 2007 9:49:33 AM EDT''
*** '''CC''': I think the "systemic" (whole-ness, "integrum") aspect plays a major role in the individuation of persons, and less so (most likely not at all) for mere objects and processes. Any contiguous macroscopic object, for example, can reasonably be regarded as (or simply ''is'' for those wary of epistemical intrusions) a conglomerate/aggregate of fiat objects and viceversa. Same for processes. I think a distinction between objects and processes on the one hand, and aggregates on the other, cannot in the last analysis be consistently maintained.
** ''July 11, 2007 10:31:18 AM EDT''
*** '''MP''': It's usefull to think of things in terms of being aggregates if you wish to say something about the parts you don't wish to say about the whole, or if you wish to describe a process of assembly or dissasembly.  Nearly everything we deal with can be thought of as a dual between the whole object vs all of the parts of which it is composed, together with their physical relationships to each other. However, our representations seldom ''need'' to describe objects at this level of detail.  If we need to state one of the components of a complex instrument generates a magnetic field deflecting ions, then clearly we need to describe the instrument as composed of parts with that function inhering in one of these parts.  If we had a gel tank loaded with a gel, that assembly is a whole, and the gel one of the parts, and there is a process of putting the gel into the gel tank and of taking it out again. Here parts are useful. My only concern would be we don't end up asserting things as being atomic or aggregate on the basis of how we want to think about them that day. This would be a '''''Bad Thing''''' for future work.
**** '''BB''': Agreed.
*** '''MP''': Following the ''avoidance of explosions of naming'' principle, the vast majority of potential aggregates and even a majority of the aggregates that come into existance during an experiment, will be un-named. Instead, they will be identified by their key component parts. E.g. given '''v''' containers and '''w''' things that will fit into containers, we wouldn't create '''v.w''' terms but rather say '''a''' '''''contained_in''''' '''b''' for any particular '''a''' and '''b''' drawn from '''w''' and '''v''' that happen to be expedient in a particular process.
** ''July 11, 2007 11:12:25 AM EDT''
*** '''CC''': Note in BFO not only aggregates have parts.  Objects are allowed to have parts also.
**** '''BB''': The current '''bfo:object''' examples would fit to Cristian's assertion.  It's the BFO implementation that concerns me - e.g., how do we use BFO + OBO-RO to fully specify some of these objects consisting of parts?  The current '''bfo:object''' definition (v1.1beta) only makes matters worse, as it ''seems'' to contradict Cristian's assertion.  I know this particular definition has been the subject of considerable debate both on the BFO list and at meetings.  I think we need a more cogent defintion and some '''''VERY CLEAR''''' graphical examples (e.g., OWLViz) which can help to make the realtions more explicit. 
***** '''bfo:object''' ''defintion'' = "A independent continuant that is spatially extended, maximally self-connected and self-contained (the parts of a substance are not separated from each other by spatial gaps) and possesses an internal unity. The identity of substantial objects is independent of that of other entities and can be maintained through time and through loss and gain of parts and qualities."
***** '''bfo:object''' ''examples'' = "an organism, a heart, a chair, a lung, an apple"
** ''July 11, 2007 12:18:51 PM EDT''
*** '''BB''': These choices as to granularity cannot be made lightly and need to be driven - as much as possible - by a consistent and consensual understanding of when OBI has a need to describe the ''atoms''.  I believe this was a part of what Susanna was asking for yesterday at the Bethesda OBI session - i.e., we as a group need to more fully define a consistent set of OBI-wide policies to address these issues arising in the context of editing nearly every OBI branch.
*** '''BB''': Nearly every use of parafilm and filter paper in the course of performing some investigation-related action - will not require describing the constituent parts of those types of objects.  Many applications which include instances of "buffer solution" will require a description of the constituent parts of the buffer.  For those instances of buffer where the constituent parts need not be represented directly, then the aggregate_object (probably derived through inference, but saved to some application version of OBI - will that really work in OWL?) can be instantiated.
*** '''BB''': One of the reasons we added 'example_of_usage' as a required metadata property was to guarantee we are able to identify either an instance or sub-class exemplifying how - within OBI - the declared class differs from all other classes with which it has been declared as being disjoint.  If the group as a whole cannot describe an example relevant to OBI's mission where the representation must capture this mereological sub-division of the class, then it probably should not be declared in OBI as an object_aggregate.
*** '''BB''': I'm uncertain as to whether a gel matrix will need to be represented as an object_aggregate.  My initial remark was merely intended to indicate it --might-- need to be represented this way. Having said this, there are certain protocol_applications where one would need to represent the fact a researcher cut a "spot" out of a gel OR a piece of filter paper.  I can remember cutting spots out of filter paper used for paper chromotography, where the spot contained H3-Chloramphenicol containing molecules (from a CAT assay).  The excised spot was then placed in a scintilation vial with scintillant so as to quantify that specific spot's amount of H3 in a scintilation counter.  I'm not certain whether this coincides with all necessary and sufficient conditions behind what Barry was trying to communicate about aggregate objects at the meeting yesterday.
