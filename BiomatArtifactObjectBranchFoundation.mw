==Foundational semantic framework for material objects (biomaterial and instrument branches)==

Initial efforts to organize the root of the material branches ('''Biomaterial''' and '''Instrument''') led to the creation of a base class '''artifact_object''' intended as a means of separating biologically-based objects ('''immortal_cell''', '''ChEBI_object''', '''xenograft''', etc.) from non-biological physical materials artificially ''shaped through human craft'' (e.g., '''Instruments''', '''Cardinal_part_of_instrument''', etc.).

Further review by the larger group of OBI developers that took place during the [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Bethesda2007Workshop bi-annual OBI Developer meeting in July 2007 at the NIH in Bethesda, MD] led to two fundamental questions:
# It appears quite difficult to consistently define the boundary between ''biological'' and ''artificial'' materials.  The existence of classes under '''Biomaterial''' such as '''ExperimentalBiomaterialEntity''' and '''NaturalBiomaterialEntity''' seem to highten as opposed to resolve the issue by drawing attention to the arbitrary and potentially inconsistent boundary between ''natural'' and ''artificial'' biologically-derived material.
# Whether or not the boundary is considered arbitrary, the question remains as to what the primary classification for material objects should be.  The discussion has focussed on:
#* whether and/or how to use the ontology normalization Design Pattern to define the core hierarchy with alternative hierarchies defined via inference?
#* if normalization is to be used, how and which ObjectProperties and Qualities will be required to support inferring all the needed classification hierarchies?
#* if normalization is to be used, will we want to deploy a version of OBI where inferred classification hierarchies are saved as asserted classes for the convenience of the community of OBI users?

==Core Material Object Classification==
===Current (2007-07-19) High-level OBI subclasses of bfo:Object===
* '''biomaterial_entity'''
** definition: A biomaterial entity is an object of biological origin.
*** definition_source: OBI.
** editor_note: Domain of an object property ''has_role_which_can_only_be_played_by_biomaterial_entity'' in obi before split, Range: ''?role_which_can_only_be_played_by_biomaterial_entity'' (LF 040907).
** branch: Biomaterial
** sub-classes: '''chimera''', '''geneticInformationContent''', '''cell derived from multicellular organism''', '''immortal cell''', '''substance''', '''supernatant''', '''artificially engineered biomaterial''', '''fragment derived from protein''', '''biosource_provider''', '''cultivar''', '''differentiation_state''', '''genetic_modification''', '''molecular_mixture''', '''organism_status''', '''entity_of_organismal_origin''', '''ChEBI_objects''', '''toBeDiscussed''', '''xenograft''' - and
*** '''ExperimentalBiomaterialEntity'''
**** sub-classes: '''cell cuture''', '''library''', '''synthetic polypeptide''', '''organ_section''', '''Bronchial_Alveolar_Lavage (BAL)''', '''cdna_library''', '''cell_culture_supernatent''', '''display_library''', '''lysate''', '''peptide_construct''', '''transgenic_organism''', '''whole_mount''', '''cell_pellet'''
*** '''NaturalBiomaterialEntity'''
**** sub-classes: '''unicellular organism''', '''cell''', '''ecotype''', '''organism''', '''organism_part''', '''population''', '''serotype''', '''strain''', '''biological_macromolecule''', '''organism''', '''in_vivo_biomaterial'''
* '''artefact_object'''
** definition: An artefact_object is an object that is produced or shaped by human craft, especially a tool, weapon, or ornament of archaeological or historical interest.
*** definition_source: http://www.answers.com/artefact
*** definition_editor: Frank Gibson
** examples: Examples include the siblings of device and other objects such as gel matrices; used in gel electrophoresis, filter paper, parafilm and buffer solutions.
** sub-classes: '''cardinal_part_of_instrument''', '''device''', '''_collected_relations''', '''physical_document'''

* Discussion (heavily edited)
** from OBI Bethesda Meeting - ''July 10''
*** '''BB''': I don't understand why we need artefact objects
*** '''HP''': Didn't we decide on phone call to remove artefact. 
*** '''BB''': Get rid of artefact
** ''July 11, 2007 4:37:17 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': This class is here to have a separation from biomaterial. It is not just a parent class for instruments. We have spent alot of time producing these classes, we did not just include them on a whim. The class is there to provide a holder for man-made object such as polyacrylamide gels, which are not instruments not labware and not biomaterials but are objects.
** ''July 11, 2007 4:55:49 AM EDT''
*** '''AR''': The definition didn't seem to work as intended. Domesticated animals are shaped by human craft, as are transgenic mice, yet these were also considered to be Biomaterials.
*** '''AR''': What inferential power will the superclass have - if you know something is an artefact_object then how can use that piece of information for profit?
** ''July 11, 2007 5:14:34 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': (Yes), the definition of Biomaterial needs more clarification, if we are to define its disjoints. I would definitely agree biomaterial captures context specific information. Where would nucleic acids and amino acids go in the hierarchy?  Are they a '''biomaterial''' or are they what ''''defines'''' a biomaterial?
