==Foundational semantic framework for material objects (biomaterial and instrument branches)==

Initial efforts to organize the root of the Biomaterial branch led to the creation of a base class '''artifact_object''' intended as a means of separating ''naturally occuring'' objects and those created ''artificially through human action'' whether they be based on Biomaterials (e.g., cell lines, tissue whole mounts, etc.) or non-biological physical materials (e.g., instruments and instrument parts).  Further review by the larger group of OBI developers that took place during the [bi-annual OBI Developer meeting in July 2007 at the NIH in Bethesda, MD] led to two fundamental questions:
# Whether or not it is considered arbitrary, it appears quite difficult to consistently define the boundary between ''natural'' and ''artificial'' materials.
# The question remains as to what the primary classification for material objects should be.  The discussion has focussed on:
#* whether and/or how to use the ontology normalization Design Pattern to define the core hierarchy with alternative hierarchies defined via inference?
#* if normalization is to be used, how and which ObjectProperties and Qualities can be used to represent all the required logical entailments?
#* if normalization is to be used, will we want to deploy a version of OBI that where inferred classification hierarchies are saved as asserted classes for the convenience of the community of OBI users?
