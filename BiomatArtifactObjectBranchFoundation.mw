==Foundational semantic framework for material objects (biomaterial and instrument branches)==

Initial efforts to organize the root of the material branches ('''Biomaterial''' and '''Instrument''') led to the creation of a base class '''artifact_object''' intended as a means of separating biologically-based objects ('''immortal_cell''', '''ChEBI_object''', '''xenograft''', etc.) from non-biological physical materials artificially ''shaped through human craft'' (e.g., '''Instruments''', '''Cardinal_part_of_instrument''', etc.).

Further review by the larger group of OBI developers that took place during the [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Bethesda2007Workshop bi-annual OBI Developer meeting in July 2007 at the NIH in Bethesda, MD] led to two fundamental questions:
# It appears quite difficult to consistently define the boundary between ''biological'' and ''artificial'' materials.  The existence of classes under '''Biomaterial''' such as '''ExperimentalBiomaterialEntity''' and '''NaturalBiomaterialEntity''' seem to highten as opposed to resolve the issue by drawing attention to the arbitrary and potentially inconsistent boundary between ''natural'' and ''artificial'' biologically-derived material.
# Whether or not the boundary is considered arbitrary, the question remains as to what the primary classification for material objects should be.  The discussion has focussed on:
#* whether and/or how to use the ontology normalization Design Pattern to define the core hierarchy with alternative hierarchies defined via inference?
#* if normalization is to be used, how and which ObjectProperties and Qualities will be required to support inferring all the needed classification hierarchies?
#* if normalization is to be used, will we want to deploy a version of OBI where inferred classification hierarchies are saved as asserted classes for the convenience of the community of OBI users?

* Discussion (heavily edited)
** from OBI Bethesda Meeting - ''July 10''
*** '''BB''': I don't understand why we need artefact objects
*** '''HP''': Didn't we decide on phone call to remove artefact. 
*** '''BB''': Get rid of artefact
** ''July 11, 2007 4:37:17 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': This class is here to have a separation from biomaterial. It is not just a parent class for instruments. We have spent alot of time producing these classes, we did not just include them on a whim. The class is there to provide a holder for man-made object such as polyacrylamide gels, which are not instruments not labware and not biomaterials but are objects.
** ''July 11, 2007 4:55:49 AM EDT''
*** '''AR''': The definition didn't seem to work as intended. Domesticated animals are shaped by human craft, as are transgenic mice, yet these were also considered to be Biomaterials.
*** '''AR''': What inferential power will the superclass have - if you know something is an artefact_object then how can use that piece of information for profit?
** ''July 11, 2007 5:14:34 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': Would a better response not have been, "lets work on the defintion of both biomaterial and artefact_object", rather than, "lets delete it"?
**** '''AR''': Perhaps - '''IF''' we can justify the value of doing so. There's a lot to be done and one must prioritize. Nothing is permanent, or closed for discussion. If you think this should be kept open and want to try to work on a better definition, then let's.  But do give a little more thought about whether it is worth the effort and perhaps defend that it is a bit.
*** '''FG''': (Yes), the definition of Biomaterial needs more clarification, if we are to define its disjoints. I would definitely agree biomaterial captures context specific information. Where would nucleic acids and amino acids go in the hierarchy?  Are they a '''biomaterial''' or are they what '''''defines''''' a biomaterial?
**** '''AR''': Yup
** ''July 11, 2007 5:29:20 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': aretfact_object was developed as a disjoint to biomaterial. If biomaterial is deleted or re-worked, then likewise artefact_object may follow or cease to be an issue.
** ''July 11, 2007 6:24:11 AM EDT''
*** '''AL''': As AR said, there's room for more discussion later on if necessary. The consensus of the group when I presented (in addition to what AR & BB say above), was that the children of artefact_object could just as easily be moved up to be disjoint siblings of biomaterial, rather than having artefact_object be disjoint.
**** '''FG''': I disagree,  However, this is dependent on what Biomaterial is meant to capture - if it should exist at all. Clearly, the definition of '''Biomaterial''' requires more work before determining if its disjoints are correct. 
** ''July 11, 2007 6:24:15 AM EDT''
*** '''BB''': Out of necessity, HP sought to capture the consensus in the minutes.  The exchange you excerpted does give the impression this change was made very quickly and my resolving comment appears flippant.  Neither was the case.  During the lengthy discussion, several of us came to agreement that - as Alan summarized it - there needs to be a sufficiently clear and consistent boundary for class distinction to be ''useful''.  To state it in the inverse, '''''IF''''' there is an important and useful distinction to be made, then the definitions (and/or axioms/restrictions) must be specified to support algorithmically recognizing that distinction (through asserted or inferred entailments).  The specification of human manipulation/craft as a means to distinguish ALL artefact_objects from Biomaterial_objects is not sufficiently clear, consistent, and scalable.  Though nearly all of us appeared to have an implicit sense this distinction was important, we struggled with how best to make this distinction explicit so as to avoid inconsistent statements when applied to all sub-classes and instances of '''Biomaterial''' and '''artifact_object''' under consideration.

==Separating Objects and ObjectAggregates==
* Discussion (heavily edited)
** ''July 11, 2007 6:24:15 AM EDT''
*** '''BB''': Re: the '''artefact_object''' examples (see above) - There is a mix of objects (filter paper, parafilm) and object_aggregates (gel matrix, buffer solution).  My classification here may appear to be based on an arbitrary definition of granularity.  Rather, given OBI's particular application requirements - capturing distinctions critical to the complete representation of an investigation - filter paper and parafilm parts will likely not be needed , whereas the composition of a buffer and --probably-- a gel matrix are details likely relevant to either evaluating, interpreting, or reproducing investigations where those entities play a critical role.  There may be some contexts where a few buffer global qualities (e.g., pH, temperature, etc.) will suffice, but there will also be times when solution composition will be critical to the protocol_application.
** ''July 11, 2007 7:49:09 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': To add confusion to the issue, a gel matrix is only an object aggregate if it is composed form other objects. If you buy a pre-made and cast gel matrix from a vendor does it cease to be an object aggregate?
**** '''BB''': In an experiment where that is the case, then one need not capture the process used to manufacture the gel - however, just to describe it as investigational tool, you may still require capturing some of its composite elements (e.g., 10% TBE gels).  It ''might'' be expedient and appropriate to simply capture this as a global quality of the gel object.  However, if there's a need to capture the way in which the sample or reagents interact with or are affected by the components of the TBE buffer (i.e., Tris, Borate, and EDTA) when interpreting the results of the investigation, then it may be necessary to at least break out the gel matrix from the buffer.  When the gel is manufactured in the lab, sometimes it will be relevant to capture the amount of Ammonium Persulfate and TEMED used to polymerize the matrix based on what biomaterial sample is being separated and how quickly the gel needs to be used.
**** '''AR''': To describe the constitution of a composite entity, one must describe its composite parts regardless of the process of used to put it together. If it's an object aggregate when you put it together, then it's an object aggregate if someone else puts it together.  
**** '''AR''': That said, we did discuss that the whole object aggregate versus object distinction is unclear. Barry believes it can be disambiguated, but - at a minimum - he's not unconfused me yet.
** ''July 11, 2007 9:15:34 AM EDT''
*** '''FG''': As to granualirty - where do we draw the line? If we are describing molecules and chemicals as objects, then anything that is composed of these "atomic parts" (to use the word loosely) is an aggregate_object? Who benefits from having an aggregate class anyway?
*** '''FG''': I'm not intending to start a controversy, but maybe we could do the same as Protocol vs ProtocolApplication, and say everything is an object for now, rather than aggregate.
