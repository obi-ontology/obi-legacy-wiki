This document will guide you through the maze of OBI. It's intended for those not familiar with OBI and aims to be an easy read document giving you all the minimum information for a quick understanding of OBI.



== OBI: short & simple ==

'''What?'''<br>
<br>
OBI is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology Ontology] for the description of biological and clinical investigations using [http://www.ifomis.org/bfo BFO] as its [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology upper-ontology].
* An [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology Ontology] captures the concepts used within a specific domain along with its relations for those concepts. It's a controlled (usually community driven) effort to create a shared vacabulary for the specific domain.
* BFO is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology upper-ontology], which describes the very general concepts of scientific research where various domain ontologies can reside.
* OBI is such a domain specific ontology (cf. a more 'specific' ontology focussed on a specific domain), using BFO as its framework (cf. using the more general concepts) targeting biological and clinical investigations. 

'''Scope?'''<br>
<br>
The ontology will represent the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type analysis performed on it. Its primary goals are:
* to develop ontology for Biomedical Investigations in collaboration with groups representing different biological and technological domains involved in Biomedical Investigations 
* to make OBI compatible with other bio-ontologies
* to develop of OBI using an open source approach
* to create a valuable resource for the biomedical communities to provide a source of terms for consistent annotation of investigations

'''Who?'''<br>
<br>
OBI is being [[#Consortium|developed by]] individuals from different biological and technological domains involved in Biomedical Investigations.

== The idea(s) behind OBI ==

The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) addresses the need for controlled vocabularies to stimulate the integration of experimental data. OBI captures representation of designs, protocols, instrumentation, materials, processes, data and types of analysis in all areas of biological and biomedical investigations. 

This need was originally identified in the transcriptomics domain by the Microarray Gene Expression Data Society (MGED), which developed the MGED Ontology as an annotation resource for microarray data. Recognizing the convergent needs of the protein and metabolite characterization, MGED become FUGO (Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology). FUGO was later on extended with clinical and epidemiological research and biomedical imaging (=OBI). OBI captures captures representation of designs, protocols, instrumentation, materials, processes, data and types of analysis in all areas of biological and biomedical investigations. 

=== The Scope of OBI ===

The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) project is developing an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical investigations. This ontology will support the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. This leads to the formulation of the following goals:
* Develop an Ontology for Biomedical Investigations in collaboration with groups representing different biological and technological domains involved in Biomedical Investigations
* Make OBI compatible with other bio-ontologies
* Develop OBI using an open source approach
* Create a valuable resource for the biomedical communities to provide a source of terms for consistent annotation of investigations 

The ontology has the scope of modeling all biomedical investigations and as such contains ontology terms for aspects such as:
* biological material - for example blood plasma
* instrument (and parts of an instrument therein) - for example DNA microarray, centrifuge
* information content - such as an image or a digital information entity such as an electronic medical record
* design and execution of an investigation (and individual experiments therein) - for example study design, electrophoresis material separaition
* data transformation (incorporating aspects such as data normalization and data analysis) - for example principal components analysis dimensionality reduction, mean calculation

Less 'concrete' aspects such as the role a given entity may play in a particular scenario (for example the role of a chemical compound in an experiment) and the function of an entity (for example the digestive function of the stomach to nutriate the body) are also covered in the ontology.

=== BFO, IAO and OBI ===

OBI uses the Basic Formal Ontology upper level ontology as a means of describing general entities that do not belong to a specific problem domain. As such, all OBI classes are a subclass of some BFO class.

=== Organigram ===
The OBI project is an international, collaborative effort to build an ontology to be used for annotation of Biomedical Investigations. The OBI Consortium is the name under which the OBI project authors its work.
