==Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity Branch==

The Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity Branch is an [[ObiBranches|OBI Branch]] concerned with identifying entities and relations to describe information entities that can be interpreted by a computer or documented and communicated.

== Scope ==
The scope of the Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity branch is to identify essential entities to describe objectives, hypotheses, data, and text related to an investigation.

Here's the currently published version of the NCBC-wide Software/Resource Ontology:
	http://bioontology.org/projects/ontologies/SoftwareOntology/

This is an ongoing project to provide a shared semantic framework & lexicon for describing the software tools being hosted or developed by the collection of NCBCs:
	http://na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/SDIWG:_NCBC_Resource_Yellow_Pages_and_Software_Ontologies

The ontology NCBCs are developing for this purpose is indirectly linked to the effort across NCBCs to come to an agreement as to what ontologies/terminologies/classification schemes NCBC's collectively agree to use to cover their annotation requirements:
