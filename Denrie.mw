==Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity Branch==

The Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity Branch is an [[ObiBranches|OBI Branch]] concerned with identifying entities and relations to describe information entities that can be interpreted by a computer or documented and communicated. 

[[HomePage|<<Back to Homepage]]

== Scope ==
The scope of the Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity branch is to identify essential entities to describe objectives, hypotheses, data, and text related to an investigation.

==Current OBI types==
* "digital_entity" Def: digital entity is an information entity which is a collection of bits that can be interpreted by a computer.
* "non-realizable_information_entity" Def: an information entity is a dependent_continuant which conveys meaning and can be documented and communicated.

Here's the currently published version of the NCBC-wide Software/Resource Ontology:
	http://bioontology.org/projects/ontologies/SoftwareOntology/

This is an ongoing project to provide a shared semantic framework & lexicon for describing the software tools being hosted or developed by the collection of NCBCs:
	http://na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/SDIWG:_NCBC_Resource_Yellow_Pages_and_Software_Ontologies

The ontology NCBCs are developing for this purpose is indirectly linked to the effort across NCBCs to come to an agreement as to what ontologies/terminologies/classification schemes NCBC's collectively agree to use to cover their annotation requirements:

I've also been meaning to bring up the issue of what they've been trying to do on this front in the BioMOBY project (something I assume has come up before in the context of MGED work):
	listings:
		objects
			http://mobycentral.icapture.ubc.ca:8090/sswap/RESOURCES/MOBY-S/Objects/listing.html
		namespaces
			http://mobycentral.icapture.ubc.ca:8090/sswap/RESOURCES/MOBY-S/Namespaces/listing.html

	ontology (viewable in SWOOP):
		http://biomoby.org/RESOURCES/MOBY-S/Objects

I think there are pros & cons to the way they are currently proceeding, but its clear many of their objects are certainly entities we want to cover in this branch of OBI.
