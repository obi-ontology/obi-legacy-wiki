==Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity Branch==

The Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity Branch is an [[Branch_development|OBI Branch]] concerned with identifying entities and relations to describe information entities that can be interpreted by a computer or documented and communicated. 

[[Main_Page|<<Back to Homepage]]

== Scope ==
The scope of the Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity branch is to identify essential entities to describe the output of measurements, types of files, and information content. 

==Digital Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity conference calls==
Notes and schedule for calls can be found at the

==Current OBI types==
* "digital_entity" Def: digital entity is an information entity which is a collection of bits that can be interpreted by a computer.
* "non-realizable_information_entity" Def: an information entity is a dependent_continuant which conveys meaning and can be documented and communicated.

** Point 1: Plan Branch - Philippe Rocca Serra: first part down to Children of Protocol Application
*** relationships between DENRIE and Plan
*** issues with objectives, hypotheses, conclusions
** Melanie Courtot - Quality
*** terms from DENRI - voltage etc need better definitions - the definitions were old for datum. They agreed that these are qualities. AR thinks they are dispositions.

* General items
** Branch/Individual review of other branches by March DL:Mar 15
* Items involving DENRIE
** Make the connection between the visulation between table and graph that comes out of this process currently that is in the DENRI branch. A cross branch issue. DT, DENRI. JM. DL:Feb 15
** issue that we need a quality like thing of 'Gifness' and how works with DENRI. could also be solved by using feature om OBI as above, again a work around BS/AR: DL:?When info ontology is tackled?
*** Types can bear quality like things features and mathematical function and this is a workaround here where classes are created in OBI for math entities. Outside BFO so needs to be OBI and would mean that we don't need a relation. New class called feature - has_feature relates a type to a feature, all base, degree and number are features of type. DT branch and CC, AR, BS. DL:21 Feb phone call
** Alan will generate a list of problems and solutions with DENRI for discussion on a conference call. Info ontology. DL: Dealt with in calls
** BS will provide a better name for MeasurementUnit as Units pre-exist in the world outside data and so the name is bad. DL:May 1
* Items involving DENRIE marked as DONE
** Edit:InformationEntity will be renamed plan, synonym RealizableInformationEntity
** Edit:DigitalEntity->child of NonRealizableInfoEntity, Plan will be a sibling of NonRealizeableInfoEntity, both children of InfoEntity
** EDIT:Objective now child of InfoEntity
** EDIT:Define Objective add a definition, synonym is GOAL

<pre>
Here's the currently published version of the NCBC-wide Software/Resource Ontology:
	http://bioontology.org/projects/ontologies/SoftwareOntology/

This is an ongoing project to provide a shared semantic framework & lexicon for describing the software tools being hosted or developed by the collection of NCBCs:
	http://na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/SDIWG:_NCBC_Resource_Yellow_Pages_and_Software_Ontologies

The ontology NCBCs are developing for this purpose is indirectly linked to the effort across NCBCs to come to an agreement as to what ontologies/terminologies/classification schemes NCBC's collectively agree to use to cover their annotation requirements:

<pre>
I've also been meaning to bring up the issue of what they've been trying to do on this front in the BioMOBY project (something I assume has come up before in the context of MGED work):
	listings:
		objects
			http://mobycentral.icapture.ubc.ca:8090/sswap/RESOURCES/MOBY-S/Objects/listing.html
		namespaces
			http://mobycentral.icapture.ubc.ca:8090/sswap/RESOURCES/MOBY-S/Namespaces/listing.html

	ontology (viewable in SWOOP):
		http://biomoby.org/RESOURCES/MOBY-S/Objects

I think there are pros & cons to the way they are currently proceeding, but its clear many of their objects are certainly entities we want to cover in this branch of OBI.
