The OBI WIKI uses The [http://www.wickle.com/wikis/index.php/Graphviz_extension Graphviz Extension] to create diagrams using the dot language. Tutorials on how to create diagrams with Graphviz can be found [http://www.graphviz.org/ here]. This extensions is mainly used to quickly create diagrams without the need of uploading any files and changing a diagram on the wiki page itself. 

Do note that you can not create overlapping clusters (Venn diagrams) using Graphviz. Documentation on how to work with Graphviz can be found [http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php here].

Some examples of diagrams using dot:
