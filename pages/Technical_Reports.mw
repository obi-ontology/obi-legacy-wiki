== Term submission ==
* Go with tracker items

Add and notify or submit via tracker and discuss first. Consensus is that terms following an accepted (and posted) design pattern can be added (could be via QTT) without prior discussion - just send email afterward. Discuss first if term not part of design pattern. 

* [[Quick_id|Quick term submission for an OBI ID]]
No use case for Quick ID proposal now. QTT might supercede this in the future.
