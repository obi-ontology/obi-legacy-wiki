=== Agenda for October 2009 Cleanup meeting ===

''Agree a process for OBI 1.0 release, clean up issues below for discussion:''

<hr>
Meeting info:<br>
The Cleanup workshop will be held in the 13th floor library of Blockley Hall. 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA, 19104 except for Sunday, the first day, where we will meet in the 14th floor conference room. These are in the Penn Center for Bioinformatics. 
Parking is available in a secured parking garage at 38th & Walnut ($20 per day) and an open lot just pass the University Avenue bridge ($7 per day I think).

Hotel info:<br>
If you plan to attend the clean up meeting in Philadelphia and need a place to stay, you may find difficulty in booking a room especially on Sat. Oct. 17 (our meeting is scheduled from Sunday Oct. 18 to Wed, Oct. 21). Not sure what's going on - perhaps the Philadelphia Film Festival?

Anyway, when I checked yesterday there were still rooms available at hotels near the airport on Sat. Oct. 17. 
There is a Marriott ( http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/phlar-philadelphia-airport-marriott/ ) 
attached to the airport but others close by. (try Google maps with "hotels near philadelphia airport")

To get into town, there is a train, the R1 that runs from the airport into Philly with a stop at Penn.

However, I can also give people rides as well.

For the rest of the dates there are B & Bs such as

Here's a site with other B & Bs.

If you are feeling lucky, the two hotels nearest Penn are the Sheraton (http://www.philadelphiasheraton.com/) and the Inn at Penn (http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/PHLIDHH-The-Inn-at-Penn-A-Hilton-Hotel-Pennsylvania/index.do).
but these were booked when we checked.

== General clean up items ==
 

''' Remove _classname - placeholder classes '''

e.g. _realizable entity, _under discussion

note: _realizable entity and other top level buckets are only there to provide an anchor for defined classes. I would vote in favor of keeping those "development helper" classes in a separate file, along with OWL2 bits and all things we don't want in the released file. Other example of unwanted things is disjoint between obsolete classes and bfo:Entity, as this may create inconsistencies for users importing OBI and somehow defeats the purpose of obsoleting classes.

''' Remove editor notes '''

some difference of opinion here, BP/HP want to remove these, AR thinks they add value
MC: happy to distribute editor notes if those were cleaned up. I don't think that this will happen realistically, nor that it should be a priority before release, so I would vote for removing them.


''' Resolve all obsolete term useage'''

should be done by next release, will need checking again

''' Resolve classified tree wierdness'''

probably needs a manual check of defined classes

''' Remove duplicates'''

e.g mass spec

''' Decide what to do with issues relating to requests to modify other ontologies e.g. RO'''

resolve/workaround/leave?


''' Check leaf nodes with a single child, and check there  potential additional children'''

''' Clean up quality branch (aka conferred/historical qualities) '''

== Release related items ==



'''Use of obsolete terms'''

Extracted from the deprecation policy google doc - Implement scripts to find obsolete classes by either: deprecatedClass/deprecatedProperty, "obsolete" curation status, or being a subclass (direct or inferred) of ObsoleteClass or ObsoleteProperty. Update all such cases to remove axioms other than the single subclassOf, to update the curation status, and, optionally, to mark as owl:deprecated. [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=886178&aid=2837221&group_id=177891 tracker item]

''' Resolve editor attribution '''



''' Check inconsistencies'''

''' Produce a saved inferred version '''


''' Mireot terms '''

anything mireoted should probably be up to date in OBI 1.0 - do we have means to check this?

== Minor issues to resolve now ==


''' Enforce curation status '''

Two issues 

*3.1. curation status is not up to date and needs to be for release 
*3.2 review terms where curation status is really not complete and prioritise if any need to be done for release, and add to tracker

''' Spellcheck, check for consistent class naming style'''

''' Resolve cases where there are no logical/text definitions '''

''' Resolve inconsistent logical/text definitions'''

'''Clean up editor attribution'''
policy is one editor's name per annotation property, using PERSON: xxxxxx
