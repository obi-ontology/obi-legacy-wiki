This page is intended for those pages related to the admin of the OBI wiki. Read through the guidelines to know how to edit/create pages. 


= 'Wiki Admin' category Pages  =
This category lists the regular pages which aren't special pages, but nevertheless are used to manage and maintain the wiki. Do note that this list does not list the [[Special:Specialpages | special pages]].

= Using the wiki =

This wiki uses the wiki editing rules, but has some custom guidinglines for 
: - creating new pages
: - creating diagrams
: - creating tables


== How to create a new page (Namespaces) ==

To keep the wiki clean, we recommend to use the following logic when creating a new page:


* '''Start 'general', end specific''' 
: To avoid pages/namespaces such as '13July' which could mean anything from a note of a conference call to the agenda of a workshop on the 13th, you should start of general and end your namespace with the most specific element. In the case of a workshop this means that you start of with 'Workshop OBI' followed by the place of the workshop (e.g. Vancouver'), the year (e.g. 2008)...


: Example 1: Conference_call_developers (and not developers_conference_call)
: Example 2: Workshop_OBI_Vancouver_2009_13_July_notes
: Example 2: Workshop_OBI_Vancouver_2009_13_July_agenda

* '''Is it part of a 'group'?'''
: Some of the pages you need to create are part or recurring events such as workshops, use cases, case studies, conference calls... To allow the wiki admin for an easy overview on such pages, do use the structure appropriate for these pages. The following pages require a specific name-structure:
:: - Use case: use "Use_case_Example_x"
:: - Case Studies: use "Case_study_Example_x"
:: - Conference Calls: use "Conference_call_TheBranch_TheDate_notes/agenda/..."
:: - Workshops: Workshop_OBI_Place_Date_...."
:: - OBI releases: use "OBI_release_v_1-0" (= OBI release version 1.0)


* '''Add the category'''
:Categories are used to organize and structure the wiki. It e.g. allows you to navigate to the category 'Workshops' and get an overview of all the 'workshop pages' on the wiki. The only thing you need to do is add the appropriate category to the page using the following syntax:
: <pre>[[category:CategoryX]]  [[category:AnotherX]] [[category:Example 3]]</pre>
: You can add it to the bottom or top, but for consistency reasons add it to the bottom of the page. 

:To see what kind of categories we have, check [[Special:Categories | this page]]. If you feel like creating another category, feel free to do so but do notify those who keep an eye on the wiki. 

* '''Add the datum''' 
: Adding the datum to your namespace helps to get a quick overview of the actual pages in the the [[Special:Allpages | special pages]]. Add the datum if it's related to a:
:: - Workshop (notes of the workshop_OBI_Zimbabwe_2071_August_4)
:: - Conference call (when there is a need for a page e.g.: conference_calls_developers_2054)
 
: Example 1: Workshop_notes_2008_july_9 (and not 2008_Workshop_notes or Notes_workshop_2008_winter)
: Example 2: workshop_OBI_Zimbabwe_2071_August_4
: Example 3: conference_calls_developers_2054

* '''Do we really need another page for this?'''
: When you create a page, then do so if it's really needed. One can easily add notes of regular events (such as conference calls) to a page 'conference calls developers 2009 instead of creating a separate page for notes of that event (e.g. don't create 'notes_23_August').

* '''Comment in the 'Summary' field''' or check 'minor edit'
: When you edit a page, it's always good to add some comment. These comments make it easier to keep an overview on what the new edits are (and which ones need to be edited to keep the wiki clean).

== Create Diagrams ==

This wiki is able to create diagrams without the need of uploading any file. Using a simple syntax, one can create complex diagrams. The advantage is that others can edit the diagram on the wiki and there is no longer a need to download the original file (of the diagram). These diagrams use the language 'dot' for the creation of the files. Some examples are shown [[Graphviz_example | here]].

Some disadvantages:
* dot does not (yet) allow for Venn diagrams (cf. overlapping clusters)
* Large diagrams tend to become (too) big. This can be resolved by decreasing the font size or by applying ranks to the various elements


== How to Create Tables ==

To allow for a consistent styling of tables, we created a class in the main.css file. This class defines the headers, the width and length of the tables. It is recommended to use this class, and overrule some of its style if needed. 
(in progress).

For a more detailed overview on how to use tables, see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Table this wikipedia page]].
