== Case Studies ==
A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study case study] is a description of a scenario that you would like OBI to represent. For example the description of a particular scientific experiment. A case study can be a textual description or represented more formally. The following is a list of case studies that have been submitted for representation within OBI. A case study is not the same as a [[Use_case| use case]]. A use case shows how OBI can be used for a particular application. Each case study has its own page.

A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case use case] demonstrates how OBI can be used for a particular application. It demonstrates the use of OBI. A use case is not the same as a [[Case_study |case study]]. Each use case is listed below and forms a separate page.

==Case Study 0001==

We wish to annotate an experiment performed as part of an investigation in which the effects of a particular amino acid substitution in the PB1-F2 protein of influenza virus is being evaluated. Although the investigators consider the experiment in question to be one experiment, several discrete steps of sample processing, assaying and data analysis are involved as listed below.  We would like to annotate the experiment in such a way as to allow the ability to recognize other experiments that use some of the same sub-process steps.

This case study was submitted by Richard Scheuermann, Jan 2008 and the full description of the case study can be found [[Case_study_0001| here]].


== Decision processing in the Caudate Nucleus ==

Submitted: 15-07-2009

This case study would like to annotate a cognitive neuroscience experiment, where a 'top-down/bias' effect is found in the caudate nucleus using single unit recordings in 2 adult male monkeys. 

Full description can be found[[Case_study_decision_caudate_nucleus | here]].
