This is a fictionalized case to test OBI modelling, especially of populations. The scenario is an investigation of the immunological basis for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis hay fever].

Notes:

* consider this a work in progress
* this uses the development version of OBI, at the time of writing, which means BFO terms are from [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2010-05-25/ruttenberg-bfo2.owl ruttenberg-bfo2.owl]
* code uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax) Turtle syntax].
* the modelling is not complete at this time, but the goal is to provide a proper RDF graph

These are the URI prefixes used in the remainder of the document. The default prefix ":" is used to refer to particulars in this case study.

Here we define some particulars for the case: Bar Lab and three people.

<pre>

</pre>

We only include subjects meeting the following criteria: "adults age 18 - 60 with a clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis but no asthma, and a hematocrit value above 38%". We model this using an "eligibility rule".

<pre>
:bar-eligibility-rule
  rdf:type obi:0500026 .
</pre>

Now we model two populations. The first is all the human beings in the world that conform to the eligibility rule. It includes John and Jane, but not Jimmy. The second is a subset containing just those human beings who are enrolled in the study. It includes John, but not Jane or Jimmy. (Is has_part the correct relation for a member of a population? We haven't modelled time.) We also model the enrolment process for the study.

<pre>
:bar-eligible-population
  rdf:type obi:0000181 ;  # is an: OBI population
  bfo:0000051 :john-doe ; # has part: John Doe
  bfo:0000051 :jane-doe . # has part: Jane Doe

:bar-enrolment
  rdf:type obi:0600004 ;                 # is an: OBI human subject enrolment process
  # realizes some concretizes some :bar-eligibility-rule
  obi:0000293 :bar-eligible-population ; # has specified input: eligible population
  obi:0000299 :bar-enrolled-population ; # has specified outut: enrolled population

:bar-enrolled-population
  rdf:type obi:0000181 ; # is an: OBI population
  bfo:0000051 :john-doe ; # has part: John Doe
  # has size 100
  # Jane Doe is not part of the enrolled population
</pre>

(We should pick a more specific assay type.)

<pre>
:bar-assay
  rdf:type obi:0000070 ;                 # is an: OBI assay
  obi:0000293 :bar-enrolled-population ; # has specified input: enrolled population
  obi:0000299 :bar-datum-1 ;             # has specified output: OBI measurement datum (data set?)
  # took place in January 2013
</pre>

<pre>
:bar-datum-1
  rdf:type iao:0000027 ;                 # is an: IAO data item
  iao:0000136 :bar-enrolled-population . # is about: enrolled population
</pre>

<pre>
:bar-drawing-a-conclusion
  rdf:type obi:0001834 ;                       # is an: OBI drawing a conclusion process
  obi:0000299 :bar-conclusion-textual-entity . # has specified output: conclusion
</pre>

The conclusion is something along these lines: "We have identified a pool of 20 peptides that accounts for about 40% of the IL-5 producing T cell targets in timothy grass allergic donors." It is about the eligible population.
