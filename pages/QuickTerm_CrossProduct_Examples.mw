Let's look at an example provided by Philippe. 

There are a number of terms that are need that are of the form: 


*Example 1: gene expression assay using DNA microarray:

'''Proposed Template:'''

'''<assay>''' '''''utilizes_instrument''''' some '''<instrument>''' and '''''has_output''''' some information content entity about '''<bfo entity>'''

once a template has been submitted and validated, a table for submitting terms built using the template can be created as follows:

'''Variables''' are terms which may be classes and are indicates by <> in the template and may be used to define column headers in the submission table

'''''Relations'''', which are indicated in bold&italic in the template, are then subsumed and do not show up in the table.


{| border="1"
|<assay>
|<instrument>
|<bfo entity>
|-
|OBI:OBI_70;assay 
|EV:070000;Microarray platform
|GO:GO0010467;gene expression
|-
|OBI:OBI_70;assay 
|OBI:OBI_submitted;DNA microarray 
|GO:GO0010467;gene expression 
|-
|}


*Example 2: DNA binding site identification using DNA microarray

Relies on the previous template. The example indicates simply another OBO Foundry term source.

{| border="1"
|<assay>
|<instrument>
|<bfo entity>
|-
|OBI:OBI_70;assay 
|EV:070000;Microarray platform
|SO:SO 0000235; transcription factor binding site
|-
|OBI:OBI_70;assay 
|OBI:OBI_submitted;DNA microarray 
|SO:SO 0000235; transcription factor binding site 
|-
|}



*Example 3: protein identification using mass spectrometry

In this last example, another template is proposed. It relies on the current definitions of Assay in OBI

'''Proposed Template:'''
''<OBI_instrument>'', '''''uses''''' ''<reagent>'', '''''has_input''''' ''<object>'', '''''has_output''''' ''<GO or CHEBI>''

object = OBI terms under material and any external object term we are committed to import (Chebi, cell ontology, ncbi organism taxonomy, ... ?)

General input sheet for assay quick submissions:


{| border="1"
|OBI instrument (will accept OBI instrument terms)
|<reagent>(will accept any object)
|<input> (will accept any object)
|<output> (will accept GO + OBI )
|-
|OBI:49
|
|
|CHEBI:36080
|-
|}



{| border="1"
|OBI:XXX
|
|
|CHEBI:36080
|-
|}

--> creates: 'assay that utilizes instrument <mass_spectrometer> and has_output information content entity on some <proteins>'

Same example as top above re-worked

step1: submit to the tracker the term that is missing in OBI (in this case DNA microarray, which is currently missing in OBI), [In this case, this is no longer a quick submission]

step2: instrument is now available in OBI as OBI:XXX. the devised scheme can now be used straight away as: 

Again, once established, this could therefore be a totally automated submission process.
