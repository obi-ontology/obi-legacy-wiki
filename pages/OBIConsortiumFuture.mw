<b>Reducing the OBI consortium membership to active ones post-publication.</b><br>

The first phase of the OBI Consortium has involved engaging as many communities as possible to contribute to OBI. The publication of a major manuscript on and first official release of OBI will be landmark events. As we move on to continue development of OBI, the issue of reducing the OBI  Consortium membership to those actively involved has been raised to a provide less diluted credit but also a clearer understanding as to who is contributing and expectations of OBI members. Any major discussion or changes will not be started until after submission of the publication. For now, we can start with brainstorming on the wiki. There will need to be a vote on any proposed changes to the current structure.<br>

<b>Discussion points made during the July 8, 2009 Coordinators call:</b>
*Alan Ruttenberg: If we are to vote, we need a trimmed list so people know what they are voting for (at least if it goes outside this meeting)
*James Malone: i would suggest we have a complete re-apply for OBI
*Chris Stoeckert: can ask people what their commitment will entail
*James Malone: turn up for calls, be willing to host dev call, be willing to accept action items, if you don't do these things then you are revmoed
*Melanie Courtot: what about "good standing system" from w3c?
*Alan Ruttenberg: summary: advisory board means you must respond to explicit queries, say 2 out of 3 times.
