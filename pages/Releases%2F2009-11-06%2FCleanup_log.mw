Alan, working on editor note cleanup.

=== Checking that the editor notes that just have msi ids all have appropriate definition sources ===

=== What was done to editor notes ===
* All editor notes were reviewed and categorized into several categories by Alan. Melanie reviewed and made some changes, almost all of which were accepted. The results are in the columns "disposition" (alan's) and "disposition 2" (melanies). 
** "check" - a tracker item will be entered
** "ignore" - is ignored already
** "definition editor" - misplaced definition editor
** "todo" - a tracker item will be entered
** "obsolete" - an obsolete term
** "asked philippe"  - editor notes "MO" or "MSI" - he said to delete
** "asked jennifer" - CDISC definitions
** "separate"  - put in a separate file (not for release)
** "user" - possibly of interest to user
** "delete" - obsolete note

* Those editor notes marked "separate" "check" "todo" "asked jennifer" were changed into "curator note" annotations. If there was a mark in "disposition 2" it was preferred over whatever was in "disposition".
* Those marked "user" were left as editor notes
* All other notes were discarded.

All are currently in the single obi file. Curator notes will not be included in release.

(misc notes)

* Fixed definition source for carbon nanotube column
* Deleted all msi_xxx editor notes
* Marked all editor notes on obsolete terms as "obsolete". Ignore these and just move them to obsolete file when we do obsoletes.
* Marked all NMR
* Marked all alanr notes "this should be moved to obi" as "delete"
* Marked all "NMR" notes as "separate" = keep in separate file
* Asked Philippe about "MSI" note on fractional factorial design OBI_0500016 (+ others marked "ask philippe") - He says delete.

=== Preferred labels ===

I reviewed all the cases where a current editor preferred label differed from an rdfs:label, and classified them into 4 cases.

* "e": the preferred label is in fact an example of usage. I fixed this in the obi source file
* "f": The rdfs:label had a typo in it. I fixed the rdfs:label in the obi source file and ignored the editor preferred label
* "n": The editor preferred label is not an alternative term. I discarded it when generating the release. These currently are maintained in the obi source file but will be removed if there is not disagreement on my assessments.
* "y": The current editor preferred label looks like a reasonable alternative term. I fixed these in the obi source file. If there is disagreement about any of these please put in a ticket.

Here's the query I used to get the initial list:

<pre>
PREFIX obi: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?term ?label ?preflabel
WHERE { 
?term rdfs:label ?label . 
?term obi:IAO_0000111 ?preflabel . 
FILTER ((!((str(?label) = str(?preflabel)))) && (!(regex(str(?label),"obsolete"))) && regex(str(?term),"OBI_"))}
