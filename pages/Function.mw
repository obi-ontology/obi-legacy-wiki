=== 5. General Guidelines ===

Communities are compiling lists of their ~Function term requirements (preferably following the naming conventions<sup>[[NamingConventions|2|]]</sup>) as a tab-delimited file  (term name and definition) - all needed terms if time permits. Examples below provide general guidance on how Function term defintions should be specified.  As this branch is built out, a term's parent class should also be specified. Currently only a parent obi:function class, a placeholder for GO:Molecular''function, and OBI:Instrument''function exist.  As the examples below make clear, we will also likely have foundational function classes for:
*Assay_function
*Assessment''function (likely a specialization of Assay''function)
*Indicator_function (e.g., fluorophores, radiolabels, optically dense indicators such as HRP & DAB/Ni)
*Reagent_function
*Algorithm_function
*Instrument''part''function (not really a type of Instrument_function)
*Analytical''instrument''function (according to Instrument Branch discussions, devices such as dialysis tubing that do not produce data will be considered a type of Instrument.  The collection of Instruments that directly produce the observations collected for analysis [[colloquially referred to as "data"]] will be sub-types of Analytical_instrument)

As the BFO:function definition makes clear, functions are end-directed activities manifested by specific continuants.  Functions typically provide a description of how a variety of continuants inter-relate in a particular context. With this in mind, it is expected definitions submitted for particular functions will include a reference to the continuant exhibiting it, as well as other continuants and occurents involved in the function. Necessary additional continuants and occurents, if not internal to OBI, should be derived from existing ontologies when possible, preferably one amongst the [[http://obofoundry.org/ OBO Foundry]] constellation of ontologies.

The Function branch editors will be responsible for communicating to other branch editors a continuant residing in the branch they curate is linked to a specific function.

Finally, the Functions to be covered by OBI will be those specifically related to investigational details such as executing a protocol, performing an assay, or using an instrument.
