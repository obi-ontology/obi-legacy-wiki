'''Schedule'''

Morning sessions will be 9-12, afternoon 1-5

''Monday morning''  

Introductory session
 - Bjoern (OBI overview and IEDB)
 - Jie  (EuPathDB)
 - Carlo
 - Marcos
 - Jessica
 - Philippe
 - Chris (manuscript + state of OBI)

''Monday afternoon'' 

 - Services (Carlo)
    - Finalize the discussion we started in Vancouver last year.
    - Discuss design pattern and examples in OBI to discuss (is service a subclass of the related planned process offered as service?) 
    '''- Result: Carlo and Matt to write up modeling and circulate'''


  - Reagents (Carlo) 
    - brief presentation of the work done since the Vancouver workshop
    '''- Result: Submit those material entities to OBI that are in scope (processed materials used as reagents)'''


 - Shortcut Relations (Carlo)
   - Start with example from services (e.g. organization X 'offers service' Y)
   - Participants should provide additional use cases / examples 
   '''- Result: Go ahead with implementation of 'service provided by' as a shortcut; (similar to achieves_objective), Use domain / Range approach to have minimal inference already.''' 


''Tuesday morning''
 - Genotype (Jie/Chris) 
  - Discuss definition of genotype, allele, wildtype as needed for OBI 
  '''- Result: Jie and Chris to move relevant classes and definitions from ExpDesign.owl into obi.owl. Produce a writeup and circulate. Further discussion required for 'genetic material''''. 

''Tuesday afternoon''
 - Experimental Design for functional genomics (Chris/Jie)
   - complete to meet requirements by Jie
  '''- Result: Writeup produced, and circulated to Philippe for comment. Afterwards, circulate to all. Go ahead with implementation of study designs via MappingMaster."'''

 - Epitope assay needs for IEDB (Bjoern) 
   - presentation of assay solution
   - discuss impact on assay vs. study design
   '''- Result: Allow complex assays, meaning all IEDB needs are met. '''

''Monday night (potential reschedule to Tuesday because of weather)''
 - BBQ - Villa Peters (622 Colima Street, La Jolla)
   '''- Result: fat and happy with German and butter'''

''Wednesday morning''
 - Community views 
   - FGED view (Chris / Jie)
   - IEDB view (Bjoern) 
   - OBI slim for general use
   '''- Result: Email circulated'''

''Wednesday afternoon''
 - OBI business + coordination (Bjoern)
   - Manuscript completion '''Result:Email circulated. Input for new use cases by April 15.'''
   - discussion of challenges of software that uses OBI, how to develop it, examples? '''Result: Need to have higher frequency of releases.''' 

 - preparation for ICBO workshop '''Result is listed below'''
   - Advertisement for ICBO (complete by April 30 (paper acceptance date))
     - make an attractive announcement on OBI webpage (BP to create; ask for content by April 15)
       - refine existing proposal
       - point out what specific problems this workshop will address
     - send to mailing list 
     - direct contacts of projects that are (or should be) interested
       - consortium + all OBI mailing lists
       - who contacted OBI in the past 2 years
       - who mentioned OBI in paper
     - advertise on OBI website (new page)
     - add to ICBO website (check on easychair)
   - Prepare presentation content
     - Overview presentation of OBI (paper)
       - guiding design principles
       - what parts of OBI deal with what 
     - Eagle-i+NIF+BRO: Using OBI to coordinate large scale  knowledge base creation and management across communities
     - IEDB: Add semantic capabilities to your Database using OBI
     - EuPathDB: Use OBI to drive data collection from experimentalists
     - Philippe: Please add (?)
     - ECO: Coordinate development of existing ontologies with OBI 
  - Prepare hands on session
     - give instructions what can be prepared in advance
     - allow for follow up with indivduals developers to address specific issues

  - Release Process '''Result below'''
    - Technical problems (look like they are overcome):
      - Reasoning issues with LISP
      - OBI getting so big that stuff takes long
    - People: 
      - some steps can only be performed by Alan; manual intervention by Alan
      - need to broaden number of people that can run the process --> Carlo will observe the next release done by Jie
    - Content problems:
      - Requirements that hold up: curation status, definition source --> integrate in QTT
      - need to review generated content to make it perfect OR adjust policies to be more lenient and allow frequent releases 
    - Future frequency: 
      - Start next release following QTT for study design etc. is in 
      - Goal was to do this monthly
      - Track for next release: what are the resources necessary to get it out (Carlo to give feedback)

   - Approaches to obtain funding
       - U41 (NHGRI), http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-11-095.html, submission dates September 25, 2011; January 25, 2012; - Chris to lead preparation until ICBO, where there will be a 1st night of ICBO get together to discuss plans
       - Teaming with NCBO for tool development
       - Anita: work with disease societies
