This page describes a fictional investigation that could be modelled in OBI. The scenario involves the fictional Lake Ontario Water Quality Monitoring Agency (LOWQMA), that periodically collects samples of water from Lake Ontario. Some of these samples are acquired and tested by Foo Lab, in order to assess pollution levels in Lake Ontario.

Notes:

* consider this a work in progress
* this uses the development version of OBI, at the time of writing, which means BFO terms are from [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2010-05-25/ruttenberg-bfo2.owl ruttenberg-bfo2.owl]
* code uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax) Turtle syntax].
* the modelling is not complete at this time, but the goal is to provide a proper RDF graph

These are the URI prefixes used in the remainder of the document. The default prefix ":" is used to refer to particulars in this case study.

Here we define the two fictional agencies involved: LOWQMA and Foo Lab. We also define two periods of time -- there must be a better way to do this.

<pre>

  rdf:type bfo:0000038 ;     # is a: temporal interval
  rdfs:label "January 2013" .
</pre>

In August 2012 LOWQMA collected 100 samples of Lake Ontario water. The samples were collected in a randomized fashion, in order to be representative of all the water in Lake Ontario at that time. We'll pay attention to sample #100.

<pre>
:lake-ontario-material-sampling-process
  rdf:type obi:0000744 ;                 # is an: OBI material sampling process
  obi:0000293 dbp:Lake_Ontario ;         # has specified input: Lake Ontario
  obi:0000299 :foo-material-sample-100 ; # has specified output: sample #100
  bfo:0000057 :lowqma ;                  # has participant: LOWQMA
  # took place in August 2012
</pre>

The Foo Investigation took place later, in January 2013. Its parts include the sampling, the assay, and the drawing of conclusions.

<pre>
:foo-investigation
  rdf:type obi:0000066 ;                                # is an: OBI investigation
  rdfs:label "Foo Investigation" ;
  bfo:0000051 :lake-ontario-material-sampling-process ; # has part: the sampling process
  bfo:0000051 :foo-salt-assay ;                         # has part: the assay
  bfo:0000051 :foo-drawing-a-conclusion                 # has part: drawing a conclusion
  # took place in January 2013
</pre>

Foo Lab acquires the samples from LOWQMA, including sample #100.

<pre>
:foo-material-aquisition-process
  rdf:type obi:0600010 ;                 # is an: OBI material acquisition process
  obi:0000299 :foo-material-sample-100 ; # has specified output: sample #100
  # took place in January 2013
</pre>

Now we describe the sample as having some roles. The timing of these roles is not being modelled.

<pre>
:foo-material-sample-100
  rdf:type bfo:0000040 ;    # is a: material entity
  bfo:0000087 [
    rdf:type obi:0100051 ;  # has role: a particular OBI specimen role 
  ] ;
  bfo:0000087 [
    rdf:type obi:0000067 ;  # has role: a particular OBI evaluant role (in the :foo-salt-assay) 
  ] .
</pre>

Sample #100 is an input for an assay, which outputs some data.

<pre>
:foo-salt-assay
  rdf:type obi:0000070 ;                 # is an: OBI assay
  obi:0000293 :foo-material-sample-100 ; # has specified input: sample #100
  obi:0000299 :foo-datum-100 ;           # has specified outut: OBI measurement datum (data set?)
  # took place in January 2013
</pre>

<pre>
:foo-datum-100
  rdf:type iao:0000027 ;                 # is an: IAO data item
  iao:0000136 :foo-material-sample-100 . # is about: sample #100
</pre>

<pre>
:foo-drawing-a-conclusion
  rdf:type obi:0001834 ;                       # is an: OBI drawing a conclusion process
  obi:0000299 :foo-conclusion-textual-entity . # has specified output: conclusion
</pre>

<pre>
:foo-conclusion-textual-entity
  iao:0000136 dbp:Lake_Ontario ; # is about: Lake Ontario
  # compared to results of previous study
  # "The salt level in Lake Ontario has drastically dropped since 2000"
</pre>
