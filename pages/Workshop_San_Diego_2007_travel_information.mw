===Hotel Information

====Clarion Del Mar Inn
====
We have arranged that conference participants can stay here at the LIAI corporate rate. The hotel is about 15 minutes away by car; there is public transport (somewhat involved) going towards LIAI. Better, they have a shuttle van to/fr the institute, which participants can arrange with the concierge.

http://www.delmarinn.com/ , 720 Camino Del Mar, Del Mar, Ca 92037, Tel: 858.755.9765

The rates are $89-92 depending on location of the room within the hotel. OBI Meeting attendees can call the Clarion Del Mar Inn and tell them theyï¿½re going to attend a meeting at LIAI.  Tell the front desk that you were referred by Jody Dang and would like to get the corporate rate.  Please give them Jody's phone number (858.752.6541), so they can confirm with her that you are on the participant list. Contact me (Bjoern, bpeters@liai.org) if you are interested and were not on the list on Oct. 27, 2006.

====San Diego Marriott La Jolla
