== About this ontology ==
 
The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) project has developed an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical investigations. This includes a set of 'universal' terms, that are applicable across various biological and technological domains, and domain-specific terms relevant only to a given domain. This ontology supports the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. The ontology represents the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type analysis performed on it. OBI is being built under the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and imports terms from OBO foundry ontologies. OBI also reflects domains specific extensions which were merged into obi.owl. These include terms merged into obi.owl from the Immune Epitope Database Ontology (www.ideb.org) and community suggested terms from many communities. 

Aims:

* Develop an Ontology for Biomedical Investigations in collaboration with groups representing different biological and technological domains involved in Biomedical Investigations
* Make OBI compatible with other bio-ontologies
* Develop OBI using an open source approach
* Create a valuable resource for the biomedical communities to provide a source of terms for consistent annotation of investigations

Further reading:  You can find the OBI manuscript which this version supports at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/repository/trunk/docs/papers/release/Manuscript.doc
 
== Ontology development ==

OBI Ontology Development is collaborative, term suggestions and new community representatives are welcome. Single term can be suggested via the OBI tracker http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/tracker. 

If you represent a community and/or have many terms to suggest please email OBI OBI Developers <obi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> with details. If you would like to see the latest development version please check out the development copy of OBI from sourceforge. 

Tutorials on how to do this here: http://obi-ontology.org/page/Tutorials

The OBI wiki can be found at: http://obi-ontology.org/

== How to contact us ==

Send mail with questions about OBI to obi-users@googlegroups.com. You
can sign up for this group, or view the archives, at:
http://groups.google.com/group/obi-users

Discussion among OBI developers is at obi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. You
can sign up for this group, or view the archives, at:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/obi-devel or
http://groups.google.com/group/obi-developer

OBI term requests, as well as reports of bugs or other issues can be
entered at our tracker: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/tracker The
tracker currently requires you to have or sign up for a sourceforge
account. Please send mail to obi-users@googlegroups.com if this is
problematic.

== New to this OBI release ==
 
There are more changes since the last release than can be compactly described here. Users with questions are directed to the OBI users list.

A total of 293 new classes and 18 new instances (excluding the terms imported from external resources) were added into this release, including
* A list of terms related to the MGED ontology, most are subclasses of study design and their related assays
* A list of assay terms required by IEDB group (around 100 terms) and influenza group
* A total of 18 terms were added as instances of manufacturer, provided by influenza group

The newly added OBI classes are listed on - http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/releases/2011-04-20/merged/newClasses.html

Most of commonly used MGED ontology (MO) terms in annotation of functional genomics experiments are available in this release. The FGED community can switch from Mged Ontology (MO) to OBI. 

Design template of 'service' is remodeled as:
service is_a 'planned process' and ((realizes some 'service consumer role') and (realizes some 'service provider role'))
service has_part some 'planned process'

Eagle-i group will add specific service terms follow this template in the near future.

Some known issues are fixed.

For all the details of the difference of this release from the previous one, please check the files under http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/releases/2011-04-20/merged/

== Obsolete classes in OBI ==

The obsoletion policy is described on the OBI wiki - http://obi-ontology.org/page/OBIDeprecationPolicy

OBI enforces a strict deprecation policy: OBI Identifiers in this release are stable and will be maintained in new versions.

== Known issues ==

* This release is available only in OWL format. There is no official OBO Format version at present: OBI cannot be loaded nor viewed in OBO-Edit and is not available from the Ontology Lookup Service at EBI. 

* 8 classes are created as uncurated status. They are very likely to be changed before next release. We recommend that they not be used yet. 
  - activation
  - binding complex 3D structure determination assay
  - general scalar measurement datum
  - identification
  - questionaire
  - reagent application function
  - scalar score from composite inputs
  - specimen labeling function


== External ontology and resource mapping/imports list ==
