Here is a proposal for how we name and record version information for OBI.

Roughly, get away from numeric versions - instead favoring dates. Use vocabulary from doap - [https://trac.usefulinc.com/doap Description of a Project]. Have a wiki page for each release describing changes, what users can expect in this version.

Can still have nicknames, e.g. "Philly (aka version 1.0)", which are recorded as the label for the doap:Version

The template code is in [https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/doap.template doap.template]. It has more assertions than the below to ensure that all properties and classes are defined.

<pre>
owl:versionIRI http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/2009-08-30/obi.owl
(approximate date)
owl:versionInfo "2009-08-30"
rdfs:label "The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations"

Include (following the example of
http://ashby.csail.mit.edu/cgi-bin/obiterm?ref=OBI_0000225)

 <doap:Project rdf:about="&obo;obi/project">
   <doap:browse rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/browse"/>
   <doap:bug-database rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/tracker"/>
   <doap:homepage rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi"/>
   <doap:mailing-list rdf:resource="mailto:obi-users@googlegroups.com"/>
   <doap:release rdf:resource="&obo;obi/version-2009-08-30"/>
   <doap:SVNrepository rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/repository>
   <doap:wiki rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/wiki"/>
 </doap:Project>

 <doap:Version rdf:about="&obo;obi/version-2008-03-10">
   <rdfs:label>Philly (aka version 1.0) Release Candidate</rdfs:label>
   <rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/wiki/Releases/2009-11-06"/>
   <doap:file-release rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/2009-08-30/obi.owl"/>
   <doap:file-release rdf:resource="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl"/>
 </doap:Version>
</pre>

Unresolved as yet

Melanie: I liked having the corresponding SVN version number (even though I agree that it was not obvious that our past version was based on the SVN revision number). Doap has project version and software revision info, we could use software revision info or (and that would be my preferred option) contact them to add a new class or property "RepositoryRevisionNumber". Submitted doap ticket at http://trac.usefulinc.com/doap/ticket/10
