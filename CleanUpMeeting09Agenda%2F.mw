=== Agenda for October 2009 Cleanup meeting ===

''Agree a process for OBI 1.0 release, clean up issues below for discussion:''

<hr>


''' 1. Remove _classname - placeholder classes '''

e.g. _realizable entity, _under discussion

''' 2. remove editor notes '''

some difference of opinion here

''' 3. enforce curation status '''

Two issues 1. curation status is not up to date and needs to be for release and 2. review terms where curation status is not complete and prioritise

'''4. Resolve all obsolete term useage'''

should be done by next release, will need checking again

'''5. Resolve classified tree wierdness'''

probably needs a manual check of defined classes

'''6. remove duplicates'''

e.g mass spec

'''7. Decide what to do with issues relating to requests to modify other ontologies e.g. RO'''

resolve/workaround/leave?

'''8. resolve cases where there are no logical/text definitions '''

'''9. resolve inconsistent logical/text definitions'''

'''10. Check leaf nodes with a single child, and check there  potential additional children'''

'''11. spellcheck, check for consistent class naming style'''

'''12. resolve editor attribution '''

e.g. PERSON: Kevin Clancy


'''13. check inconsistencies'''

'''14. produce a saved inferred version '''


'''15. Mireot terms '''

anything mireoted should probably be up to date in OBI 1.0 - do we have means to check this?
