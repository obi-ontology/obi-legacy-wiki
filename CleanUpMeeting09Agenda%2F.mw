=== Agenda for October 2009 Cleanup meeting ===

''Agree a process for OBI 1.0 release, clean up issues below for discussion:''

<hr>



== General clean up items ==
 

''' Remove _classname - placeholder classes '''

e.g. _realizable entity, _under discussion

note: _realizable entity and other top level buckets are only there to provide an anchor for defined classes. I would vote in favor of keeping those "development helper" classes in a separate file, along with OWL2 bits and all things we don't want in the released file. Other example of unwanted things is disjoint between obsolete classes and bfo:Entity, as this may create inconsistencies for users importing OBI and somehow defeats the purpose of obsoleting classes.

''' Remove editor notes '''

some difference of opinion here, BP/HP want to remove these, AR thinks they add value
MC: happy to distribute editor notes if those were cleaned up. I don't think that this will happen realistically, nor that it should be a priority before release, so I would vote for removing them.


''' Resolve all obsolete term useage'''

should be done by next release, will need checking again

''' Resolve classified tree wierdness'''

probably needs a manual check of defined classes

''' Remove duplicates'''

e.g mass spec

''' Decide what to do with issues relating to requests to modify other ontologies e.g. RO'''

resolve/workaround/leave?


''' Check leaf nodes with a single child, and check there  potential additional children'''

''' Clean up quality branch (aka conferred/historical qualities) '''



== Release related items ==



'''Use of obsolete terms'''

Extracted from the deprecation policy google doc - Implement scripts to find obsolete classes by either: deprecatedClass/deprecatedProperty, "obsolete" curation status, or being a subclass (direct or inferred) of ObsoleteClass or ObsoleteProperty. Update all such cases to remove axioms other than the single subclassOf, to update the curation status, and, optionally, to mark as owl:deprecated. [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=886178&aid=2837221&group_id=177891 tracker item]

''' Resolve editor attribution '''



''' Check inconsistencies'''

''' Produce a saved inferred version '''


''' Mireot terms '''

anything mireoted should probably be up to date in OBI 1.0 - do we have means to check this?

== Minor issues to resolve now ==


''' Enforce curation status '''

Two issues 

*3.1. curation status is not up to date and needs to be for release 
*3.2 review terms where curation status is really not complete and prioritise if any need to be done for release, and add to tracker

''' Spellcheck, check for consistent class naming style'''

''' Resolve cases where there are no logical/text definitions '''

''' Resolve inconsistent logical/text definitions'''

'''Clean up editor attribution'''
policy is one editor's name per annotation property, using PERSON: xxxxxx
