===Snow===

A one evening snow trip is planned and will take place on the wednesday evening, after the meeting.
All the information on the station can be found there: http://www.cypressmountain.com/index.asp

Cost per person are around:

- board or skis + boots: 40$

- jacket+pants: 30$ as a package, 16$ each otherwise

- lift tickets: 40$ 

They don't rent small stuff, like gloves, goggles, hats... but they also rent helmets.

The place is close to the city (30 minutes) and it really is great fun!

===Remote attendance===


Daily notes summarizing discussions will be posted every evening (PST) on the wiki.

Centra calls will take place from 9 to 10 PST every morning.
Instructions on how to connect on centra:
    *  URL: http://ncicb.centra.com (click on "Attend a meeting", you don't need to sign in)
          o Code: OBIVowWK 

    * Directions to use the voice feature
          o make sure you have a microphone
          o hold down the "person talking" icon in the upper right while you talk (clicking isn't enough)


We have bee testing the centra setup, unfortunately we are getting some echo due to proximity between the microphones and the speakers in the room. Our multimedia support is looking into that.

We will try and use centra, but if the sound quality is too bad we'll use our phone conferencing system:
