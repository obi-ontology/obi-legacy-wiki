[http://www.tojos.com/ Tojos]. Extraordinary sushi . $$$$. Dinner only.

[http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&q=cilantro+jalapeno&near=Vancouver,+BC,+Canada&fb=1&cid=49263294,-123120461,14277212713840612869&li=lmd&z=14&t=m Cilantro & Jalapeno]. Classy Mexican take out (and eat in). Good place to go for a $10 lunch, better places around for dinner. 

[http://www.cactusclubcafe.com/locations/bc/vancouver/broadway-ash Cactus Club]. A bit of everything in a nice atmosphere. $20-30 for dinner.
