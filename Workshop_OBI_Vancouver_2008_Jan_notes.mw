Jennifer Fostel. Ppt

Presentation by PPT.
Need for adding roles to other than independent continuant e.g. data transformation processes

There are study variables that are factors, and cases where variables are not factors. Added concept to factor, and then need a link to a variable which is in OBI

Outcome - StatisticalFactor is a subclass
Outcome=result of plan process etc
StatisticalFactor - factor that is a conclusion that has been found to be stat. signigficant

==Discussion on Jennifer's presentation:==
RS: fraction is an ouput of assay, I view as a biomaterial transformation.
I agree with everything else on slide 5.
My use case, outout from assays are dependent continuants e.g. glucose @ 10 pg per dcl.
That phrase is an indep cont that inheres on the specimen that went in. Analyte 2 roles here, plays a role as a dependent continuant to represent something about the sample

JF:Trying to divide between quality/not. Conclusion describes a quality of the input material.

RS:Agree, quality is a quality of specimen not the analyte.

BS:Agree with RS, there's a simpler version. When you list objective to measure, you are not measurung glucose, you measure a quality of the specimen - glucose in this specimen. In all cases what you are measuring is a quality and then don't need a role. Is there a case where you don't measure a quality of a specimen.

AR:You want to say which quality, that's why we need analyte

BS:of course

AR:but which quality is what analyte, not just any quality.

BS:more than this. When define an assay, glucose is a not a role quality of a spec, so we use analyte.

AR: we need a name, or placeholder. So this is why we need analyte

JF: we need to know the objective of the assay  - measure glucose - how you do it doesn't matter. we are using analyte as shortterm. I want a term that's broader than analyte

AR:option 1. Analyte role inheres in glucose of specimen. What if there is no glucose nothing to inhere in.

RS:plays a role in plan, even if null when measured. Can inhere in the plan. 
AR:can only inhere in an independent continuant, plan is not. 
BS:can use named parts of plan e.g. goals. Analyte would be name for the part of a plan. When we use analyte, we are talking about plans, and realize
