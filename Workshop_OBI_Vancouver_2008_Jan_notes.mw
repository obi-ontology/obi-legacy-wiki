<b>1. Presentations and Discussions from branches</b>


<b>Jennifer Fostel. [[https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Image:Fostel_OBI-rolebranch-issues.ppt]]</b>

Presentation by PPT.
Need for adding roles to other than independent continuant e.g. data transformation processes

There are study variables that are factors, and cases where variables are not factors. Added concept to factor, and then need a link to a variable which is in OBI

Outcome - StatisticalFactor is a subclass
Outcome=result of plan process etc
StatisticalFactor - factor that is a conclusion that has been found to be stat. signigficant

<b>Analyte Conclusion by AR [[New page|https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Analyte]</b>

<b>AI: AR/BP/BS - will refine the analyte proposal. There are placement issues to resolve</b>

<b>Discussion</b>

RS: fraction is an ouput of assay, I view as a biomaterial transformation.
I agree with everything else on slide 5.
My use case, outout from assays are dependent continuants e.g. glucose @ 10 pg per dcl.
That phrase is an indep cont that inheres on the specimen that went in. Analyte 2 roles here, plays a role as a dependent continuant to represent something about the sample

JF:Trying to divide between quality/not. Conclusion describes a quality of the input material.

RS:Agree, quality is a quality of specimen not the analyte.

BS:Agree with RS, there's a simpler version. When you list objective to measure, you are not measurung glucose, you measure a quality of the specimen - glucose in this specimen. In all cases what you are measuring is a quality and then don't need a role. Is there a case where you don't measure a quality of a specimen.

AR:You want to say which quality, that's why we need analyte

BS:of course

AR:but which quality is what analyte, not just any quality.

BS:more than this. When define an assay, glucose is a not a role quality of a spec, so we use analyte.

AR: we need a name, or placeholder. So this is why we need analyte

JF: we need to know the objective of the assay  - measure glucose - how you do it doesn't matter. we are using analyte as shortterm. I want a term that's broader than analyte

AR:option 1. Analyte role inheres in glucose of specimen. What if there is no glucose nothing to inhere in.

RS:plays a role in plan, even if null when measured. Can inhere in the plan. 

AR:can only inhere in an independent continuant, plan is not. 

BS:can use named parts of plan e.g. goals. Analyte would be name for the part of a plan. When we use analyte, we are talking about plans, and realize

RB:sometime you find something you weren't looking for and wanted to use analyte for that

BS: then you have revised your plan.

BP:if you don't detect glucose - that's a fail, but there is also assay fail

BS:we only do canonical experiment where they are completed. Cases where there is no 'thing' we don't deal with that case, except in plan. To get all investigation we describe all successful things. Failure is a meta thing

AR:question is not about whether we find glucose. 

BS:if plan is to measure x, and there is no x, then plan should be that 'we are looking for x'  is it there

RS:Ryan's def worked

AR:didn't place in ontology

RB: one proposal

analyte-role, the thing you found has role analyte
analyte goal - in plan

Confusing to have analyte as a prefix for both

BP:only problem is that we need to inhere role in something. Inheres in the class glucose for me. As long as we don't specify that there is glucose in the sample.

JF:where do roles that are e.g. on processes go

AR:analyte in in the plan, and this is in your brain

BS:one part of plan is a part labelled for 'analyte'

AR:would need to be 'has_analyte_part'

BS:suggested some horrible concatenation. Issues with refering expressions which have no reference. There is a distinction between plans, measure x, and decide if x is there. Need to handle sep., no good solution in philosophy unless you do this. To say that even when no glucose, there is a glucose quality is bad. Everything would then have a glucose quality even when it is not there, and there are no negative qualities.

JF:what if assay is to measure a behaviour in a rat

BP:this is more complex. We do have protocols that measure non substances. Lets not go there yet.

PRS:how do you measure behaviour. E.g. exploratory behav. in rats, swimming behaviour

BP:we will be able to do that, I want to complete analyte.

AR:there are two analytes - role/goal. Is that OK

BP:No

RS:there is a goal to measure glucose. 

JF:objective of plan is to measure glucose and that is a quality of specimen. Not heard anything different. 

BS:I think when you say glucose, you mean amt of glucose in specimen where that specimen is blood

JF:if we believe amt glucose is a quality of assay, the specimen has glucose then you determine that. I have a glucometer, and it's function is to measure glucose. How do we define that use of glucose

BS:suggest when you measure glucose you measure a quality, expressed as e.g. a ratio. when measure a behavior is an independent cont aggregate, and determine a quality of that ratio of time spends smoking vs something else

BP:finish glucose first.

BS:think solution works for both.

BS:Objective is part of the plan.

RB:what's the parent for analyte-role - is it plan

BS:no it's a part of plan. All analyte role is part of some plan.

PRS; goal is a role played by a statement

BS:made before had info object, and needs to be changed

JF: would this term be in plan or DENRI.

BP:lets define the terms

Analyte Page [[https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/Analyte]] - for definitions and conclusions about analyte

MC:objective is in role, then we would need to move that

PRS:should the objective of measuring be a process:

AR:no the process is measuring

PRS:all protocol have objective, and tie then via protocol application

AR:only issue is that may be measuring something not there

PRS:no intent was to measure, and solves that problem

BP:is an objective then of a protocol

HP:absence means undetectable in this case. It's shorthand.

AR:we need to make a logical definition to tie the concept of glucose

BS:we need an 'aboutness' thing and that's been added to analyte page
