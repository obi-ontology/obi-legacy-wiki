===Artefact_object discussion===

Frank Gibson joins by phone

Problem: Consensus to avoid creating classes unless there was a need for them. Having less subclassing is helpful for annotation use case. Artefact object is not helping and there is overlap with biomaterial in the current definition. 

BS:Need a place for instruments
AR:under object
BS:where cardinal part of?
AR:under object
CS:we eliminated device
BS:I want to avoid biomaterial having siblings at a lower level
AR:I want to get rid of biomaterial and push the kids up
RS:I don't know why instrument and biomaterial entity are at different levels
CS:lets bring Frank up to speed. We went through instrument and id classes that were not useful. Having less subclassing is helpful for annotation use case. Artefact object is not helping and there is overlap with biomaterial in the current definition. Unless we found a driving need for a class that is organising children below, this affected artefact, device and perhaps biomaterial entity. 
AR:Also reasoning, want there to be inferences for assertion for subclasses and if editing a paper less is more, if remove something and it's just as good, then you didn't need it
FG:I wanted to make this disjoint with biomaterial, wasn't a device or an instrument, were thinking about 
HP:we can have cases of biomaterial that are synthetic
FG:problem with the definition of biomaterial
AR:agree
We check the definition of biomaterial_entity
BP:We talked about this definition during the call, hard to get a good definition, it's not perfect
JF:we have a lot of things under biomaterial class, my understanding is that we want to refer to some of the entities but not as a biomaterial entity in all cases
AR:what's a biomaterial entity, what's the use case for that
JF:in mage was a sample for microarray
HP:we can make our own definitions here
RS:could be replaced with role.
CS:in several other branches we don't have a clear measurement of separating them, we were going to let these sort themselves out, would be apparent which belong together based on definitions.
FG:Issue is that dealing with mult branch under object, if 2-3 branches are merging that won't work
AR:Chris you had an idea of what's natural vs unnatural, move all non natural things under artefact object
FG:Of biological origin, things that occur in nature. Or could refer as a biological substance.
CC:non biologic vs biologic and natural vs unnatural cut across
LF:if we get rid of biomaterial and artefact we need to keep these containers. We can reclassify these
AR:I thought we said just making a list shorter is not a good reason to add a class
FG:I suggest two ways - things that are natural/manmade, or what you mean by biology - and everything else isn't
AR:If I had to vote would choose man made vs. natural
CS:Thinking about branches - we have a biomaterial and instrument, have these as they have been useful organising principle. May want to continue to work in that way.
FG:There are more objects than material and instrument
BS:list them:
FG:polacrylamide gel
CS:is material that is not biomaterial
RS:organism is a portion of biomaterial
CS:why 'portion of'
BS:bad to use mass terms, hence use of portion. e.g. bad to have tissue and tooth, blood, bone, convert mass nouns to count nouns by using portion_of
AR:does everyone get the distinction between mass and count nouns.






1. Inferring hierarchies worked example e.g. Instrument?

2. Use of inter branch relations esp. between protocol/protocol application, clarification of scope

3. Use of roles, identify cases where move something from a current class to a role, provide a worked example of why for future use.

4. OBI only qualities  - experimental only?

5. Dealing with common object properties lot, etc that apply to instrument/material

6. Exploring granularity with worked examples e.g. ProtocolApplication

7. Revisiting other agenda items suggested Monday pm.




9. Flagging items that are unclassified consistently
