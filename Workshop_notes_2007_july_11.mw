===Artefact_object discussion===

Frank Gibson joins by phone

<b>Problem: Consensus to avoid creating classes unless there was a need for them. Having less subclassing is helpful for annotation use case. Artefact object is not helping and there is overlap with biomaterial in the current definition. </b>

BS:Need a place for instruments
AR:under object
BS:where cardinal part of?
AR:under object
CS:we eliminated device
BS:I want to avoid biomaterial having siblings at a lower level
AR:I want to get rid of biomaterial and push the kids up
RS:I don't know why instrument and biomaterial entity are at different levels
CS:lets bring Frank up to speed. We went through instrument and id classes that were not useful. Having less subclassing is helpful for annotation use case. Artefact object is not helping and there is overlap with biomaterial in the current definition. Unless we found a driving need for a class that is organising children below, this affected artefact, device and perhaps biomaterial entity. 
AR:Also reasoning, want there to be inferences for assertion for subclasses and if editing a paper less is more, if remove something and it's just as good, then you didn't need it
FG:I wanted to make this disjoint with biomaterial, wasn't a device or an instrument, were thinking about 
HP:we can have cases of biomaterial that are synthetic
FG:problem with the definition of biomaterial
AR:agree
We check the definition of biomaterial_entity
BP:We talked about this definition during the call, hard to get a good definition, it's not perfect
JF:we have a lot of things under biomaterial class, my understanding is that we want to refer to some of the entities but not as a biomaterial entity in all cases
AR:what's a biomaterial entity, what's the use case for that
JF:in mage was a sample for microarray
HP:we can make our own definitions here
RS:could be replaced with role.
CS:in several other branches we don't have a clear measurement of separating them, we were going to let these sort themselves out, would be apparent which belong together based on definitions.
FG:Issue is that dealing with mult branch under object, if 2-3 branches are merging that won't work
AR:Chris you had an idea of what's natural vs unnatural, move all non natural things under artefact object
FG:Of biological origin, things that occur in nature. Or could refer as a biological substance.
CC:non biologic vs biologic and natural vs unnatural cut across
LF:if we get rid of biomaterial and artefact we need to keep these containers. We can reclassify these
AR:I thought we said just making a list shorter is not a good reason to add a class
FG:I suggest two ways - things that are natural/manmade, or what you mean by biology - and everything else isn't
AR:If I had to vote would choose man made vs. natural
CS:Thinking about branches - we have a biomaterial and instrument, have these as they have been useful organising principle. May want to continue to work in that way.
FG:There are more objects than material and instrument
BS:list them:
FG:polacrylamide gel
CS:is material that is not biomaterial
RS:organism is a portion of biomaterial
CS:why 'portion of'
BS:bad to use mass terms, hence use of portion. e.g. bad to have tissue and tooth, blood, bone, convert mass nouns to count nouns by using portion_of
AR:does everyone get the distinction between mass and count nouns.
BS:instruments and portions of material, are there any other objects we need, ecpsystem is on the site side. Need a term to deal with lab stuff, labware should be portion of labware
KC:consumable?
FG:we considered that
BS:why can't we consider a testtube as instrument
GF:things that do measurements vs things that are used
BS:equipment? FG that could cover anything
AR:if equipment and portion of biomaterial do you need anything else. E .g. Liquid chemical soln is now 'portion of material'. 
BP:there are liquid solutions that are biomaterials, don't like this solution, Top leve would be portion of material in general, where would atom go
BS:portion of material. OBI should avoid it's own physics, atomics, tax of organisms. Should concentrate what happens in experiments
BP:in lab, have mass spec that uses atoms, we need this
BP:then why is equipment is not portion of material
BS:we define as such, equipment serves a purpose, material doesn't
BP:liquid buffer - made for expt purposes
AR:answer is have class of liquid non bio solution, liquid chemical soln is too broad.
BS:single inheritance for quals says that dark red is a child of red not dark
LF:the spectrum is continous, we decide not to go there
RS:we want to have both instrument and biomaterial or everything else. Why do we want to describe instrument - if we determine in a way that it generates data
C:define in terms of function
AR:everything has a function ac to current definition
BS:needs fixing
BP:could have utilizes instrument, to produce outputs from inputs - doesn't apply to heart or to portion of material. Doesn't apply to heart. BP and BS agree
CS:not clear what's driving the discussion, other than trying to come up with a way to split
CS:current way treat objects is mess, converstion -> clarity. Frank has a point we need something other than biomaterial. Shouldnt put a special case for gels, as we would get an explosion. Gels annotate to portion of material, cow parts to portion of biomaterial
CS:we put gels and cows under portion of material and instrument under equipment
FG;equipment is a role, it is a device
BS:don't like equipment? could substitute device 
RS:distinction between natural and artefact - congenic mouse line  - is hard to make difference
Liquid chemical solution -> portion of biomaterial
DNA chemical solution->p o material
BS:def of device is that we make it for a purpose
BP:if liquid chemical soln is a buffer - is is for a purpose
CS:are we getting hung up on labels? Device equipment - we want instruments and labware type stuff, challenge is names
RS:need a sibling of instrument - labware/consumable under device
BS:what are the examples?
RS:pipette, test tube, - child of device. Consumable not a good synonym, as includes material.
BP:test tube and buffer are better e.g.
AR:problem with growth medium - it's a mixture - some biomaterial plus some non biomater. Ob agg also a problem
AR:if we have liquid chem soln as a class, and child is DNA and salt in soln, DNA might be biomaterial
BS:leather strap has a function, is a device not a biomaterial
AL:of you chop up leather straps, then is a biomaterial. Can sintrument be a role
BS:no, 2 kinds of things used as instruments, e.g. using Alan as a door stop
BP:if we create one branch fr physical chem properties of matter, then soln has cells in serum will cause probs
BS:!BJOERN BEING TOO PHILOSOPHICAL NOW! - OBI is for annotating data (pots and kettles)
AR:all devices are man made. If use a non man made thing as an instrument this is playing a ole, not an is-a instrument
AR:could you split all man made devices?
BP:define what you have, can be bio or non bio. 
AR:buffer is manmade
BP:can define also how made it e.g. cell culture is biomaterial/material?
BS:we need a third axis, biological_unit - include cell, organism
BP:cell culture? BS: Is an object agregate
BS:all in OBI will be unit instrument, parts of the unit screws in instrument, aggregates into platform. Material and biomaterial are non units, they are a continuum
RS:simpler e.g. a cell can be a portion of organ, or an ob aggregate in cell culture
BS:cells and cell cultures worth persuing the idea that these are portions of biomaterial. Organism is a portion of material.
CS:have we made an improvement
AR:want to work through the real world problems 
BS:mixtures, we choose when we define portion of biomaterial. Some general dissent on this.
RS:how define biomaterial?
AR:something which was alive, or derived from such, or synthetically made to mimic life. 
BP:two views in room. make h'archy for both
GF:if we wanted to bring frank in, we have made agreement that we need to make a change, maybe Frank might like to hang up
BP:we will promise to have some class of device.
<b>FG:if you work out a biomaterial, rest will fall into place. If you need that word at all.</b>
LF:does instrument have anything to do with machine
FG:try not to use word machine.
RS:we want to split on what generates data, so put freezer in same category in test tube
FG:instrument: observe, measurement, record
BS:easy test if material  - on material - we can get more or less of it. CAn't get more of this machine
BP:Agree - upper level separation is about physical chemical basis then
BS:need organism under object as well.
AL:why can't we have something that produces data
FG:devices observe, measure record, not nec produce data
BP:we can do the portion of stuff, it's straightforward if do along single countable thing and portion of, generated by a manmade process. Works OK. If we plit cleanly there will be no mult inhertitance. Stick with that CC said.
CS:starting to be convinced that we can use this dimension to split, when I do an expt I have sep for things I am studying and this that is better represented by the first one.

Conclusions: 
* We will revisit, we need a use case for testing this. How will we deal with device? Suggestion to resort all OWL file based on these two things off line. And decide how to measure.
* BP:We could deal with man made as a high level class and infer class membership at high level
* BS thinks that man-made object will not work based on experience based on man made object, doesn't want to mess up what we have on what's a bad idea. Agreement for that. Also doesn't want physical/chemical at top, as don't know an e.g, of non physical/chemical objects and therefore is redundant.



















1. Inferring hierarchies worked example e.g. Instrument?

2. Use of inter branch relations esp. between protocol/protocol application, clarification of scope

3. Use of roles, identify cases where move something from a current class to a role, provide a worked example of why for future use.

4. OBI only qualities  - experimental only?

5. Dealing with common object properties lot, etc that apply to instrument/material

6. Exploring granularity with worked examples e.g. ProtocolApplication

7. Revisiting other agenda items suggested Monday pm.




9. Flagging items that are unclassified consistently
