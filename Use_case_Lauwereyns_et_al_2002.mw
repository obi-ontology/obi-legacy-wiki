* Short description (from JBMS paper): This investigation studied the role of the primate caudate nucleus in the expectation of reward following action [Lauweyrens et al., 2002]. While the caudate nucleus responds preferentially to eye movements in different directions, the response begins prior to eye movement and is dramatically increased when there is expectation of reward for the preferred direction. Here we represent a single trial in which the visual target, a light, is presented to the animal and the neural response is recorded as data.
* Those classes and relations not in OBI (19 May 2010) have a gray background.

'''Description in article''':

: ''Visual stimuli were small red spots, 0.2&deg; in diameter, back-projected onto a tangent screen by LED projectors.'' (p. 416)

: ''In the CST, there was a first fixation period of 1 s, followed by a brief presentation (100 ms) of a cue at 20&deg; to the left or to the right. '' (p. 417)

The diagram shows that the DOT as ''project_by'' the LED projector (''projects_on'' the tangent screen), is a dot which is ''left_side_of' the central fixation dot (as projected on the tangent screen) with a 20&deg; angle. The diameter of the dot is 0.2&deg; wide and has the color red.

'''Description in article''':
: ''In the BST, the monkey was required to direct and maintain his gaze at a central fixation spot during a first fixation (‘pre-target’) period of 1.5 s. Visual stimuli were small red spots, 0.2&deg; in diameter, back-projected onto a tangent screen by LED projectors. After the pre-target period, the fixation spot disappeared and a peripheral target appeared at 20&deg; to the left or to the right. The monkey had to make a saccade within 500 ms to within 38 from the target position. A beep was presented as feedback for each correct trial. If the monkey made an error, the same trial was repeated. In half of the correct trials the monkey was rewarded with a drop of water depending on the reward schedule. During blocks of 20 or 40 correct trials, reward was mapped consistently onto one target position. We reversed the position reward contingency automatically (6–16 times) without any indication to the monkey.'' (p. 416-417)

* Concerns Condition 1 of the BST paradigm (see description above and p. 414 figure 1a in paper). When a left stimulus is presented the subject is not rewarded with juice, when a right stimulus occurs (and subject makes correct saccade) the subject receives a reward. 
* A single trial consists of 3 blocks in the experimental design (1, 2 and 3 in figure): 
: 1. 'resting phase' where subject is awaiting a new trial
: 2. 'fixation': subject has to fixate the central dot
: 3. 'saccade': central fixation stimulus disappears, subject is presented a peripheral stimulus (left/right of central fixation), subject has to make a saccade within 500ms
* Each trial is repeated for 20 or 40 correct correct trials (in figure '1 sequence of trials with identical reward scheme'). 
* After 20-40 correct trials the reward scheme is reversed (in figure lower '1 sequence of trials with identical reward scheme') 6-16 times (randomly).
* Condition 2 differs from condition 1 for its reward (reward on left stimulus, no reward on right stimulus).
