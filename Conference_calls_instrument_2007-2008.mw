====Summary of the Instrument Branch Conference Calls====

22. April 2008

Agenda:
 same as last week

*[[InstrumentMinutes22Apr2008|Minutes]]


15. April 2008

Agenda:
*review what BFO has to say about Function definitions (bill? + email of 29/03/2008 06:23 to Barry))
** e.g. we link to function via a "bearer_of" SOME bfo:function owl:Restriction
** Protocol_application would do the same via "realizes" SOME bfo:function owl:Restriction
** For each instrument I with function F there is a protocol_application P that has_participant instrument I which realizes function F as part of P.
** Functions sould get all the OBI required metadata including  definitions of the bfo:function
*review new colums added to the left of the device fct spreadsheet at http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pT8ShyqlllIVSL43Cm6zRBQ&hl=en
**has_bearer range (as derived from def), to populate device top level
**bearer-superclass   (shall we start to add these in the owl file?)
* add further BFO compliant definitions
*[[InstrumentMinutes15Apr2008|Minutes]]


8. April 2008
* skipped


1. April 2008

Agenda:
*review what BFO has to say about Function definitions 
*review Bills email to Barry: "Since the branch imports BFO, they can certainly  build off the bfo:function there.  They would then link to that  function via a "bearer_of" SOME bfo:function owl:Restriction"
*review alternative function modelling strategies (borders to roles, protocol application (processes) and relations) as far as our needs and table is regarded.
*review Functions definitions on
