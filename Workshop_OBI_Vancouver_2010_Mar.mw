 - OBI development tools (QTT, MIREOT etc.)

2. Tuesday 23rd - 9am to 12am and 1pm to 5pm

Use case driven issues session ('We have issues'), ~1/2 day each

Format: 
 0) Premeeting: Prepare 1-4 
 1) present use case 
 2) summarize progress to date 
 3) introduce issue that needs work
 4) hands on development, and commit to file

3. Wednesday 24th -  9am to 12 am and 1pm to 5pm 

morning: 'We have issues'

afternoon: Planning
 - What is driving OBI post 1.0? 
 - Taking on new groups + use cases vs. tackling difficult bits of existing ones
 - Should we revise coordinator structure? 

4. Thursday 25th - 9am to 12am and 1pm to 5pm

morning + afternoon: 'We have issues'

===Use Case + Issues Proposals===

* Use case: Immune Epitope Database export
 - Integrate IDO terms into OBI
 - Qualitative positive / negative measurements
 - tying epitope 'conclusions' to assay outcomes

* Use case: Annotate the MAGE-TAB format files, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/files/E-TABM-34/E-TABM-34.idf.txt E-TABM-34.idf.txt] and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/files/E-TABM-34/E-TABM-34.sdrf.txt E-TABM-34.sdrf.txt] using OBI. <br> 
The E-TABM-34 files have been used to demo several software including annotation creation tool, eg. annotare, data and annotation management software, eg. CaArray, and data analysis platform, eg. GenePattern, MeV.
 - Integrate MO terms into OBI
 - Annotate microarray experiments using OBI and further other kinds of experiments, such as Chip-seq and RNA-seq

* Use case: Vaccine Adverse Event (OBI and VO)
Farrington CP. Control without separate controls: evaluation of vaccine safety using case-only methods. Vaccine 2004;22:2064-20.

Our project involves the active surveillance for Adverse Events of Special Importance(AESI): in particular GBS, encephalitis syndromes, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The surveillance will be in PCIRN SOS sites using standardized case definitions. 
The purpose is to test the hypotheses of causality and to contribute to the worldwide safety data being assembled for adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine.  We will be using the  Farrington method which compares the risk of an event happening during a known period of exposure â€“ ie during the six weeks after immunization with the risk of it occurring during intervals of similar duration (six weeks) but not after exposure to vaccine, using individuals as their own controls.  Essential to the methodology is ascertainment of cases with a date of onset and a specific date of immunization (or confirmation that no immunization was given during the entire study period).

===Participants===

* Ryan Brinkman (Mon-Thu)
* Melanie Courtot (Mon-Thu)
* James Malone (Mon-Thu)
* Bjoern Peters (Mon-Thu)

=== Extracurricular Activities ===


[http://www.cypressmountain.com/index.asp Cypress] does not look like it will be a viable option this year. We'll play it by ear will organize something if they get snow. 

A whole day trip to [http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/index.htm Whistler] ([http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/todo/winter/index.htm for non skiers] [http://www.tourismwhistler.com/www/things_to_do/activities/winter.asp another]) is planned on the Friday, and weekend for those that want to stay longer. They've had record snow this year. Please sign up below if you are interested in sharing a chalet or some other sort of accommodation over the weekend and we'll work something out. As for transportation, 
[[http://www.greyhound.ca Greyhound is the best way to go]]
You want to travel from Vancouver to Whistler village (or Creekside)
You probably want the 6:30 am ride up to get there for when the mountain opens at 8:30
The mountain closes at 3:30, so the 4:30 gets you back downtown at 7. Ryan is happy to work out details with those interested. Please add your name to the appropriate section below if you are interested.

*Day trip:

*Weekend (indicate # of nights if you are interested in possibly getting a shared chalet (etc.)):
**Ryan (2 nights, Fri/Sat)
**Helen +1 (Fri  26-31 March)

===Things to organize===
* Power bars
* Whistler transportation
* Dinner reservations (Banana Leaf Malaysian / Cactus Club upper scale pub/ Plaza 500 west coast/ Indian Buffet / All u can eat sushi on Broadway / Memphis Blues BBQ)
* Lunch catering (kitty? Tracy's food book & delivery)
