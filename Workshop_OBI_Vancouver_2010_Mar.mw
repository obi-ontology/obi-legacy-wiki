James Malone says:

"I would like to consider for an agenda item usability of OBI, with
particular reference to how we are going to get other people to use OBI
with minimal effort possible. This may mean reviewing some of the more
"archaic" parts of OBI. I would certainly favour anything that makes it
more accessible.  I would welcome some discussion on this asap, perhaps
via email will suffice.

On today's call there was a view held by some that a couple of days of
outreach with external projects, effectively 'teaching' on things like
using MIREOT, OBIs structure, representing a measurement, QTT etc might be
useful. This would suggest a different meeting from normal with less
emphasis on development

There was also a suggestion we might charge a small reg fee to attend this
2 day session as well, with all the implications therein, i.e. there would
need to be proper organization and structure to this to give value."

=== Extracurricular Activities ===


[http://www.cypressmountain.com/index.asp Cypress] does not look like it will be a viable option this year. We'll play it by ear will organize something if they get snow. 

A whole day trip to [http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/index.htm Whistler] ([http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/todo/winter/index.htm for non skiers] [http://www.tourismwhistler.com/www/things_to_do/activities/winter.asp another]) is planned on the Friday, and weekend for those that want to stay longer. They've had record snow this year. Please sign up below if you are interested in sharing a chalet or some other sort of accommodation over the weekend and we'll work something out. As for transportation, 
[[http://www.greyhound.ca Greyhound is the best way to go]]
You want to travel from Vancouver to Whistler village (or Creekside)
You probably want the 6:30 am ride up to get there for when the mountain opens at 8:30
The mountain closes at 3:30, so the 4:30 gets you back downtown at 7. Ryan is happy to work out details with those interested. Please add your name to the appropriate section below if you are interested.
