Proposal (in obi.owl for draft + tracker items): "providing a service": a planned process executed by a service provider with the objective to enable a service consumer to achieve an objective. Realizes some (is_concretization of some 'plan_specification') and ('inheres_in' some has_role some role)) and achieves_planned_objective some 'objective specification

AI: Eagle-i to continue work on this in separate file, and present on OBI call
Eagle-i to join developer call 

1.15pm to 5.30pm<br>

* 1.10 - 1.15: ISMB 2010 Workshops Evidence Codes: Assay Tracking, ECO and OBI

History: An evidence tracking Workshop has been approved at ISMB. OBO Foundry decision was substantial overlap with OBI and there should be coordination of efforts. Philippe has been working on this area and ECO should be invited to an OBI call where this work will be presented. <br>

AI: Richard will send OBO Foundry review to ECO as a means of introduction and invite them to a meeting. 
AI: Richard to contact Philippe to present internally to obi pre-meeting.

* 1.15 - 1.45: NIF presentation. Fahim will introduce the NIF project and how it relates to OBI.<br>
* 1.45 - 3.15: NIF use case<br>

Went through Excel spreadsheet from NIF tracker item to identify where old OBI terms used in Birnlex would map to. Updated spreadsheet uploaded. 

AI: Fahim will identify Data Transformation related terms and coordinate with James to get those into OBI.<br>
AI: Fahim will identify a NIF representative to add/edit the obi.owl file with data transformation terms.<br>
AI: Eagle-i/NIF will work with Helen over the next several days on how to edit obi.owl<br>

Ongoing: Fahim to join conference call, add new terms that work well within the hierarchy into separate file to be first imported for verification and merged into OBI. After that tackle old terms to be modified. 

* 3.15 - 3.30: break
* 3.30 - 4.00: BIRN presentation by Jessica.
* 4.00 - 5.30: BIRN use case



2. Tuesday 23rd



During workshop some effort was spent on how to model scores within OBI<br>

AI: Jessica - Report back with 5 examples developer of scales (e.g., Sledae score) and how to model in OBI based on initial model developed during workshop - April 26 developer call<br>
AI: Jessica - How to represent levels of scale into what data transformation are allowed coordinated with James/ Allan - Report back on April 26 developer call<br>



* 9 am to 9.30: BRO presentation (Trish/Dave)

AI: Trish will ensure BRO presentation will be put in OBI svn (March 28) <br>
AI: Melissa have identified instruments to be submitted to OBI on behalf of BRO (March 23) <br>
AI: Trish and Dave will coordinate with their groups to make OBI requests for terms (especially instruments) (Report back on OBI call April 30) <br>

* 9.30 to 10.30 am: Instruments efforts interoperability

Use case driven issues session ('We have issues'), ~1/2 day each

Format: 
 0) Premeeting: Prepare 1-4 
 1) present use case 
 2) summarize progress to date 
 3) introduce issue that needs work
 4) hands on development, and commit to file

Several examples of processes were worked through https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/bccrc.ca/ccc?key=0As0sauCnoElVdF94WDFkYjM0cm9sZ1E3TTY5UmFVUUE&hl=en&invite=CL_6vJ8L and these were modelled in OBI by Bjoern. The new methodology to classify instruments is through their over-arching function defined as a process combined with something else that defines instruments, which for now seems to be satisfied by added powered by electricity (e.g., chromotagraphy instruments and centrifuges have a separation function (and not contain/mechanical functions) and both plug into the wall) <br>

AI: NIF will move the example processes to a shareable document and will work through the remaining list of ~95 instruments based on the results of the modelling done by Bjoern during the meeting  (April 28)



* 11 to 12.30 and 1.30 to 3.30 pm: VO use case (Allen)

AI: Allen will place presentation in OBI svn<br>
AI: Administration types added to OBI (e.g., oral, subcutaenous, subdermal)<br>

* 3.30 pm to 5 pm: Planning
 - What is driving OBI post 1.0? 
 - Taking on new groups + use cases vs. tackling difficult bits of existing ones
 - Should we revise coordinator structure? 
 - External related efforts


3. Wednesday 24th -  9am to 12 am and 1pm to 5pm 

* 9 am to 12.30 : IEDB use case (Bjoern)
* 1.30 pm to 5 pm: MGED use case (Jie) 


4. Thursday 25th - 9am to 12.30 and 1.30 pm to 5pm

morning + afternoon: list of issues proposal

===Use Case===

* Use case: Immune Epitope Database export (Bjoern)
 - Integrate IDO terms into OBI
 - Qualitative positive / negative measurements
 - tying epitope 'conclusions' to assay outcomes

* Use case: Annotate the MAGE-TAB format files, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/files/E-TABM-34/E-TABM-34.idf.txt E-TABM-34.idf.txt] and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/files/E-TABM-34/E-TABM-34.sdrf.txt E-TABM-34.sdrf.txt] using OBI. <br> 
The E-TABM-34 files have been used to demo several software including annotation creation tool, eg. annotare, data and annotation management software, eg. CaArray, and data analysis platform, eg. GenePattern, MeV.
 - Integrate MO terms into OBI, and integrate terms used to annotate characteristics ie from other ontologies into OBI (mostly contained in EFO)
 - Annotate microarray experiments using OBI and further other kinds of experiments, such as Chip-seq and RNA-seq

* Use case: Vaccine protection investigation This is an extension of the “vaccine protection investigation” use case introduced in the OBI JBMS paper. (Allen)
 - Ontology modeling: This use case includes 18 parameters: (1) vaccine strain, (2) vaccine viability, (3) Addition of IL-12 as vaccine adjuvant, (4) Addition of SOD antigen, (5) gene deletion, (6) animal (host) species, (7) animal (host) strain, (8) animal (host) sex, (9) vaccination route, (10) vaccination dose, (11) animal age at vaccination, (12) pathogen strain for challenge, (13) challenge route, (14) challenge dose, (15) challenge time (e.g., interval after vaccination), (16) colony forming unit (CFU), (17) reduction of colony forming unit (CFU), and (18) Significance of vaccine protection (Three values: no protection, protection, enhanced protection). 
 - Instance data: We have collected ~160 instance data from the literature, which investigated the protection levels of several Brucella vaccines at different conditions (with different values of these 18 parameters). 
 - Hypothesis: Some parameters are more important than others in determining the result of the vaccine protection efficacy. 
 - Method and Result: An ANOVA analysis was performed and indicated that 12 parameters significantly contribute to the protection (P value < 0.05). The other parameters do not (P value > 0.05).  
 - Issues for discussion: (1) How to model these parameters using OBI, IAO, and VO; (2) How to model the hypothesis, ANOVA test, and the statistical results using OBI; (3) How to use OBI/IAO to help statistical data analysis of instance data? (4) Possible extension of this study to other ontology-based statistical data analysis?


* Use case: Coordinate future of BIRNLex-OBI proxy classes (Fahim)
We need to coordinate about the future of BIRNLex-OBI proxy classes (the tracker link that you sent contains the list) within NIFSTD. The NIF-Investigation module included those proxy classes few years back when OBI was yet to be stable. Those proxy classes were intended to be replaced by OBI equivalents later.  Now that we have OBI built off BFO 1.1, we need to align our progress. Now, OBI-Proxy classes were extended in NIF Investigation along with the addition of various MRI/DTI terms (coordination with Jessica Turner and Karl Helmer). Some portion of NIF-Investigation (extended from obi-proxy classes) would certainly be overlapping with current OBI.  As the original hierarchies of our proxy classes have been changed in OBI along with other changes (some of the classes became non-existent, and some of the class IDs seems to have changed in OBI), we need to be careful during the process of adapting the updated OBI.  Ideally I would think of importing OBI as a whole, given that the extended NIF classes are clearly separable with no overlaps (and OBI being comprised of only ‘universal’ bio-investigation terms with a generic hierarchy). Also, extracting a relevant portion of OBI using MIREOT approach can be an option. We need to reconcile this issue of BIRNlex-OBI proxy classes and need to come up with a good alignment approach between NIF-Investigation and the current version of OBI.

* Use case: Modeling relationships between experimental variables ('Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design'): applications within BIRN projects. (Jessica)

The [https://wiki.birncommunity.org:8443/display/NEWBIRNCC/Knowledge+Engineering+WG BIRN Knowledge Engineering Working Group] is adopting an approach that can be thought of as a simplified projection of OBI's much larger scope (and we are seeking ways to interoperate with OBI as much as possible). We adopt a variable-centric view of modeling scientific experiments that is based on understanding the relationships between the independent, dependent and derived variables of a study. This model serves as the basis for several applications within BIRN-KEWG's overall activity, including tools for data integration across databases, the development of reasoning models within defined domains (such as neural connectivity) and tools for straightforward modeling of experimental design that can then serve as the basis for generic data repositories. We present two models formulated in this framework (which we would like to bring more closely into register with OBI): tract-tracing experiments involved in the study of neural connections and fMRI studies involving the Auditory Oddball Paradigm.

Tract tracing experiments involve injecting minute quantities of tracer chemicals into animals brains, and subsequently processing those brains to stain for the presence of tracer. These techniques reveal the presence of histological labeling within cells, axons and terminals. The location of the injection, the spread of the injection site and the location, type and density of labeling provide the underlying data to understand the existence of neural projections.

The Auditory Oddball Cognitive Paradigm is a behavioral paradigm involving the presentation of standard and oddball tones, in which subjects respond behaviorally to the oddball tones. The difference between the physiological response to the standard and oddball tones is usually the dependent variable of interest.

* Use case: Modeling relationships between research resources: the eagle-i project (Melissa & Carlo)

The eagle-i consortium has the objective of developing a searchable network of research resources at research institutions nationwide. This project was funded in parallel and with the goal of interoperability with the Vivo project that will index people, their affiliations, publications, etc. We are developing an ontology for indexing and querying biomedical research entities, and this effort is being guided by discussions within the ontology community (http://RRontology.tk) aimed at promoting interoperability. We are utilizing a large set of use cases and queries to drive our ontology design.  

There is a fair amount of overlap with OBI in that many of the “resources” that we are indexing play roles in biomedical investigation. However, one difference in usage is that we are not annotating data or experiments. We will be inventorying laboratories, services, instruments, reagents, organisms, persons, protocols, human studies (metadata), tissue/biological sample repositories and training opportunities. For discussion at the OBI meeting, we’d like to focus on three aspects, namely representation of organizations providing a service and service subtypes, the relationship between protocols, techniques and planned processes, and potential classification of instruments based on function or participation in planned processes.

===Issues Proposals===

Add any item for discussion here

* Would be good to discuss OBI packaging options - different distributions of OBI for different purposes. Slims. Modules. etc.
* Adding terms: new files, main file?
* Handling convenience classes (e.g. specimen, material to be added): should they be marked, moved out of main file?
* role hierarchy: for example we have role of being first subject treated, to be treated with active ingredient role, to be treated with placebo role but treated role obsolete.
* release issue: regular release of OBI? monthly, bi-monthly?
* instrument/device: We obsolete instrument and device for adding more specific classes such as measurement device. We need other kind of device/instrument to cover micro electrode, microarray wash station, syringe, etc.
* who would take care of instrument in general? e.g. https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2887868&group_id=177891&atid=886178, or https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2855265&group_id=177891&atid=886178
* chemical solution https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2890158&group_id=177891&atid=886178  some issues regarding how chemicals in solutions should relate to parts, especially to exclude a cell in mixture not inferring as a child of this. Also issue about using roles without tying to process
* Evidence Codes: Assay and other OBI spin offs (such as proposed organization ontology ORG) - there is interest from people not at workshop so discussion summary should go to mailing list or possibly discussed on a call
* Discuss further relationship between organizations and the entities they control.
* Sham treatment
* Specified dose (left over, nice to get to)
