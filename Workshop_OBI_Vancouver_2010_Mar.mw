===Remote attendance===

Will not be available. Sorry.

===Agenda===

1. Monday 22nd - 9am to 12am and 1pm to 5pm
 - New groups introductory presentations
 - OBI overview to date
 - OBI development tools (QTT, MIREOT etc.)

2. Tuesday 23rd - 9am to 12am and 1pm to 5pm

Use case driven issues session ('We have issues'), ~1/2 day each

Format: 
 0) Premeeting: Prepare 1-4 
 1) present use case 
 2) summarize progress to date 
 3) introduce issue that needs work
 4) hands on development, and commit to file

3. Wednesday 24th -  9am to 12 am and 1pm to 5pm 

morning: 'We have issues'

afternoon: Planning
 - What is driving OBI post 1.0? 
 - Taking on new groups + use cases vs. tackling difficult bits of existing ones
 - Should we revise coordinator structure? 

4. Thursday 25th - 9am to 12am and 1pm to 5pm

morning + afternoon: 'We have issues'

===Use Case===

* Use case: Immune Epitope Database export
 - Integrate IDO terms into OBI
 - Qualitative positive / negative measurements
 - tying epitope 'conclusions' to assay outcomes

* Use case: Annotate the MAGE-TAB format files, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/files/E-TABM-34/E-TABM-34.idf.txt E-TABM-34.idf.txt] and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/files/E-TABM-34/E-TABM-34.sdrf.txt E-TABM-34.sdrf.txt] using OBI. <br> 
The E-TABM-34 files have been used to demo several software including annotation creation tool, eg. annotare, data and annotation management software, eg. CaArray, and data analysis platform, eg. GenePattern, MeV.
 - Integrate MO terms into OBI, and integrate terms used to annotate characteristics ie from other ontologies into OBI (mostly contained in EFO)
 - Annotate microarray experiments using OBI and further other kinds of experiments, such as Chip-seq and RNA-seq

* Use case: Vaccine protection investigation This is an extension of the “vaccine protection investigation” use case introduced in the OBI JBMS paper. 
 - Ontology modeling: This use case includes 18 parameters: (1) vaccine strain, (2) vaccine viability, (3) Addition of IL-12 as vaccine adjuvant, (4) Addition of SOD antigen, (5) gene deletion, (6) animal (host) species, (7) animal (host) strain, (8) animal (host) sex, (9) vaccination route, (10) vaccination dose, (11) animal age at vaccination, (12) pathogen strain for challenge, (13) challenge route, (14) challenge dose, (15) challenge time (e.g., interval after vaccination), (16) colony forming unit (CFU), (17) reduction of colony forming unit (CFU), and (18) Significance of vaccine protection (Three values: no protection, protection, enhanced protection). 
 - Instance data: We have collected ~160 instance data from the literature, which investigated the protection levels of several Brucella vaccines at different conditions (with different values of these 18 parameters). 
 - Hypothesis: Some parameters are more important than others in determining the result of the vaccine protection efficacy. 
 - Method and Result: An ANOVA analysis was performed and indicated that 12 parameters significantly contribute to the protection (P value < 0.05). The other parameters do not (P value > 0.05).  
 - Issues for discussion: (1) How to model these parameters using OBI, IAO, and VO; (2) How to model the hypothesis, ANOVA test, and the statistical results using OBI; (3) How to use OBI/IAO to help statistical data analysis of instance data? (4) Possible extension of this study to other ontology-based statistical data analysis?

===Issues Proposals===

Add any item for discussion here

* Would be good to discuss OBI packaging options - different distributions of OBI for different purposes. Slims. Modules. etc.

===Participants===

* Ryan Brinkman (Mon-Thu)
* Melanie Courtot (Mon-Thu)
* James Malone (Mon-Thu)
* Bjoern Peters (Mon-Thu)
* Helen Parkinson (Mon-Thu)
* Jessica Turner (Mon-Tues)
* Jie Zheng (Mon-Thu)
* Zuoshuang "Allen" Xiang (Mon-Tues)

=== Extracurricular Activities ===


[http://www.cypressmountain.com/index.asp Cypress] does not look like it will be a viable option this year. We'll play it by ear will organize something if they get snow. 

A whole day trip to [http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/index.htm Whistler] ([http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/todo/winter/index.htm for non skiers] [http://www.tourismwhistler.com/www/things_to_do/activities/winter.asp another]) is planned on the Friday, and weekend for those that want to stay longer. They've had record snow this year. Please sign up below if you are interested in sharing a chalet or some other sort of accommodation over the weekend and we'll work something out. As for transportation, 
[[http://www.greyhound.ca Greyhound is the best way to go]]
You want to travel from Vancouver to Whistler village (or Creekside)
You probably want the 6:30 am ride up to get there for when the mountain opens at 8:30
The mountain closes at 3:30, so the 4:30 gets you back downtown at 7. Ryan is happy to work out details with those interested. Please add your name to the appropriate section below if you are interested.

*Day trip:

*Weekend (indicate # of nights if you are interested in possibly getting a shared chalet (etc.)):
**Ryan (2 nights, Fri/Sat)
**Helen +1 (Fri  26-31 March)

===Things to organize===
* Power bars
* Whistler transportation
* Dinner reservations (Banana Leaf Malaysian / Cactus Club upper scale pub/ Plaza 500 west coast/ Indian Buffet / All u can eat sushi on Broadway / Memphis Blues BBQ)
* Lunch catering (kitty? Tracy's food book & delivery)
