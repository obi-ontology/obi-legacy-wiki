morning + afternoon: list of issues proposal

===Use Case===

* Use case: Immune Epitope Database export (Bjoern)
 - Integrate IDO terms into OBI
 - Qualitative positive / negative measurements
 - tying epitope 'conclusions' to assay outcomes

* Use case: Annotate the MAGE-TAB format files, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/files/E-TABM-34/E-TABM-34.idf.txt E-TABM-34.idf.txt] and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/files/E-TABM-34/E-TABM-34.sdrf.txt E-TABM-34.sdrf.txt] using OBI. <br> 
The E-TABM-34 files have been used to demo several software including annotation creation tool, eg. annotare, data and annotation management software, eg. CaArray, and data analysis platform, eg. GenePattern, MeV.
 - Integrate MO terms into OBI, and integrate terms used to annotate characteristics ie from other ontologies into OBI (mostly contained in EFO)
 - Annotate microarray experiments using OBI and further other kinds of experiments, such as Chip-seq and RNA-seq

* Use case: Vaccine protection investigation This is an extension of the “vaccine protection investigation” use case introduced in the OBI JBMS paper. (Allen)
 - Ontology modeling: This use case includes 18 parameters: (1) vaccine strain, (2) vaccine viability, (3) Addition of IL-12 as vaccine adjuvant, (4) Addition of SOD antigen, (5) gene deletion, (6) animal (host) species, (7) animal (host) strain, (8) animal (host) sex, (9) vaccination route, (10) vaccination dose, (11) animal age at vaccination, (12) pathogen strain for challenge, (13) challenge route, (14) challenge dose, (15) challenge time (e.g., interval after vaccination), (16) colony forming unit (CFU), (17) reduction of colony forming unit (CFU), and (18) Significance of vaccine protection (Three values: no protection, protection, enhanced protection). 
 - Instance data: We have collected ~160 instance data from the literature, which investigated the protection levels of several Brucella vaccines at different conditions (with different values of these 18 parameters). 
 - Hypothesis: Some parameters are more important than others in determining the result of the vaccine protection efficacy. 
 - Method and Result: An ANOVA analysis was performed and indicated that 12 parameters significantly contribute to the protection (P value < 0.05). The other parameters do not (P value > 0.05).  
 - Issues for discussion: (1) How to model these parameters using OBI, IAO, and VO; (2) How to model the hypothesis, ANOVA test, and the statistical results using OBI; (3) How to use OBI/IAO to help statistical data analysis of instance data? (4) Possible extension of this study to other ontology-based statistical data analysis?


* Use case: Coordinate future of BIRNLex-OBI proxy classes (Fahim)
We need to coordinate about the future of BIRNLex-OBI proxy classes (the tracker link that you sent contains the list) within NIFSTD. The NIF-Investigation module included those proxy classes few years back when OBI was yet to be stable. Those proxy classes were intended to be replaced by OBI equivalents later.  Now that we have OBI built off BFO 1.1, we need to align our progress. Now, OBI-Proxy classes were extended in NIF Investigation along with the addition of various MRI/DTI terms (coordination with Jessica Turner and Karl Helmer). Some portion of NIF-Investigation (extended from obi-proxy classes) would certainly be overlapping with current OBI.  As the original hierarchies of our proxy classes have been changed in OBI along with other changes (some of the classes became non-existent, and some of the class IDs seems to have changed in OBI), we need to be careful during the process of adapting the updated OBI.  Ideally I would think of importing OBI as a whole, given that the extended NIF classes are clearly separable with no overlaps (and OBI being comprised of only ‘universal’ bio-investigation terms with a generic hierarchy). Also, extracting a relevant portion of OBI using MIREOT approach can be an option. We need to reconcile this issue of BIRNlex-OBI proxy classes and need to come up with a good alignment approach between NIF-Investigation and the current version of OBI.

* Use case: Modeling relationships between experimental variables ('Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design'): applications within BIRN projects. (Jessica)

The [https://wiki.birncommunity.org:8443/display/NEWBIRNCC/Knowledge+Engineering+WG BIRN Knowledge Engineering Working Group] is adopting an approach that can be thought of as a simplified projection of OBI's much larger scope (and we are seeking ways to interoperate with OBI as much as possible). We adopt a variable-centric view of modeling scientific experiments that is based on understanding the relationships between the independent, dependent and derived variables of a study. This model serves as the basis for several applications within BIRN-KEWG's overall activity, including tools for data integration across databases, the development of reasoning models within defined domains (such as neural connectivity) and tools for straightforward modeling of experimental design that can then serve as the basis for generic data repositories. We present two models formulated in this framework (which we would like to bring more closely into register with OBI): tract-tracing experiments involved in the study of neural connections and fMRI studies involving the Auditory Oddball Paradigm.

Tract tracing experiments involve injecting minute quantities of tracer chemicals into animals brains, and subsequently processing those brains to stain for the presence of tracer. These techniques reveal the presence of histological labeling within cells, axons and terminals. The location of the injection, the spread of the injection site and the location, type and density of labeling provide the underlying data to understand the existence of neural projections.

The Auditory Oddball Cognitive Paradigm is a behavioral paradigm involving the presentation of standard and oddball tones, in which subjects respond behaviorally to the oddball tones. The difference between the physiological response to the standard and oddball tones is usually the dependent variable of interest.

* Use case: Modeling relationships between research resources: the eagle-i project (Melissa & Carlo)

The eagle-i consortium has the objective of developing a searchable network of research resources at research institutions nationwide. This project was funded in parallel and with the goal of interoperability with the Vivo project that will index people, their affiliations, publications, etc. We are developing an ontology for indexing and querying biomedical research entities, and this effort is being guided by discussions within the ontology community (http://RRontology.tk) aimed at promoting interoperability. We are utilizing a large set of use cases and queries to drive our ontology design.  

There is a fair amount of overlap with OBI in that many of the “resources” that we are indexing play roles in biomedical investigation. However, one difference in usage is that we are not annotating data or experiments. We will be inventorying laboratories, services, instruments, reagents, organisms, persons, protocols, human studies (metadata), tissue/biological sample repositories and training opportunities. For discussion at the OBI meeting, we’d like to focus on three aspects, namely representation of organizations providing a service and service subtypes, the relationship between protocols, techniques and planned processes, and potential classification of instruments based on function or participation in planned processes.

===Issues Proposals===

Add any item for discussion here

* Would be good to discuss OBI packaging options - different distributions of OBI for different purposes. Slims. Modules. etc.
* Adding terms: new files, main file?
* Handling convenience classes (e.g. specimen, material to be added): should they be marked, moved out of main file?
* role hierarchy: for example we have role of being first subject treated, to be treated with active ingredient role, to be treated with placebo role but treated role obsolete.
* release issue: regular release of OBI? monthly, bi-monthly?
* instrument/device: We obsolete instrument and device for adding more specific classes such as measurement device. We need other kind of device/instrument to cover micro electrode, microarray wash station, syringe, etc.

=== Extracurricular Activities ===


[http://www.cypressmountain.com/index.asp Cypress] does not look like it will be a viable option this year. We'll play it by ear will organize something if they get snow. 

A whole day trip to [http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/index.htm Whistler] ([http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/todo/winter/index.htm for non skiers] [http://www.tourismwhistler.com/www/things_to_do/activities/winter.asp another]) is planned on the Friday, and weekend for those that want to stay longer. They've had record snow this year. Please sign up below if you are interested in sharing a chalet or some other sort of accommodation over the weekend and we'll work something out. As for transportation, 
[[http://www.greyhound.ca Greyhound is the best way to go]]
You want to travel from Vancouver to Whistler village (or Creekside)
You probably want the 6:30 am ride up to get there for when the mountain opens at 8:30
The mountain closes at 3:30, so the 4:30 gets you back downtown at 7. Ryan is happy to work out details with those interested. Please add your name to the appropriate section below if you are interested.

*Day trip:

*Weekend (indicate # of nights if you are interested in possibly getting a shared chalet (etc.)):
**Ryan (2 nights, Fri/Sat)
**Helen +1 (Fri  26-31 March)

===Things to organize===
* Power bars
* Whistler transportation
* Dinner reservations (Banana Leaf Malaysian / Cactus Club upper scale pub/ Plaza 500 west coast/ Indian Buffet / All u can eat sushi on Broadway / Memphis Blues BBQ)
* Lunch catering (kitty? Tracy's food book & delivery)
