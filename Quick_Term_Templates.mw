===Overview of the Quick Term Approach===

A procedure to leverage defined class and patterns in candidate terms for inclusion in OBI,

* Agreement on the logical definition of the parent class for submissions matching a certain pattern and specification of entities that can be varied with respect to the parent class (the differentia)

* Generation of a QTT spreadsheet designed to let users specify just the differentia. This spreadsheet contains one column for each specified entity

* Processing of a QTT spreadsheet through the use of a tool that translates each row of a QTT template into the OWL description of a class

* Provide submitters with a list of Identifiers corresponding to the newly created classes.
