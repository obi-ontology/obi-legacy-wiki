As OBI evolves we find that some times terms have errors and need to be retired. The process of retiring a term is variously called making it obsolete or deprecating it. We consider the terms to be equivalent in this context and our intention is that the term no longer be used in new annotation, and that annotations that use it be revised to use a more correct term.  Before terms are deprecated, editors should post a note to relevant discussion groups, including our user mailing lists, soliciting opinions. Once the decision to deprecate has been made, an editor note (short but clear is fine) should be added explaining or pointing to a discussion of the reason why the term is being deprecated, and, if available, a suggestion of more appropriate terms to use.
