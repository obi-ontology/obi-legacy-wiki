==Relations development procedure ==

The OBI project is using the OBO relation ontology [http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/RO:Main_Page (RO)]. The following process represents how a relation is accepted in the OBI Relations.owl

# A relation is proposed via the mailing list or issue tracker.
## The proposed relation is accompanied by a case study describing its potential use.
## The proposed relation is accompanied by a definition
## The proposed relation is accompanied by proposed domain and range for the relation.
# If the relation is in the RO, then it is available for use.
# If the relation is not in the RO, then the [http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies/obo-all/ro_proposed/ro_proposed.owl RO_proposed] is checked to see if the relation exists there.
# If the relation is in [http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies/obo-all/ro_proposed/ro_proposed.owl RO_proposed] then it is include in OBI, by manually including the relation in the OBI file external-by-hand.owl. This can be considered as a [http://obi-ontology.org/page/MIREOT MIREOT] import of a relation
# If the relation is neither in RO or [http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies/obo-all/ro_proposed/ro_proposed.owl RO_proposed] then the relation is inlcuded in the OBI file Relations.owl
# Every relation in Relations.owl is in effect a proposal for inclusion into the RO.
# If a relation that is in [http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies/obo-all/ro_proposed/ro_proposed.owl RO_proposes] or in OBI Relations.owl is accepted in the RO, then OBI uses this version of the relation rather than the relation contain in external-by-hand or Relations.owl

== Relations in OBI ==

The list of relations currently proposed or being used in OBI can be found in the Relations.owl file. The relations being re-used from the [http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies/obo-all/ro_proposed/ro_proposed.owl RO_proposed] file can be found in the external-by-hand.owl file. A wiki version of this file is displayed on the [[List_of_relations | list of the relations]] page.
