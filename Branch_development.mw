==OBI Branch Development==

The development of an Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) has been divided into branches which were segregated into carefully selected none-overlapping areas of interest which would be modelled.  Each Branch has an assigned group of editors that oversee the development of a given branch.

An introduction to OBI can be found [http://obi.sourceforge.net/ at the SourceForge website ]
See the [[ObiBranches|branch outline]] for details on the branch development plan including roles and responsibilities.

==The OBI Branches==
There are 10 development branches within OBI that correspond to areas of interest to biomedical investigation.  These development branches are constituents of the planned OBI ontology, each having a specific domain scope detailing the specific area that they represent.  The 10 branches are as follows: <br>

    * [[BiomaterialTermNeeds]]
    * [[DataTransformation]]
    * [[DigitalEntityTerms]]
    * [[FunctionTerms]]
    * [[InstrumentTerms]]
    * [[PlanBranch]] (investigation design - protocol)
    * [[ProtocolApplicationBranch]]
    * [[QualitiesBranch]]
    * [[RoleTerms]]
    * [[ListOfRelationships]]
Each branch is also assigned a group of editors which are responsible for the design and development of the terms, structure and hierarchy.  Mailing lists, weekly conference calls and regular face-to-face meetings are used to progress the development of each branch in a collaborative and cooperative manner.  An introduction to OBI can be found [http://obi.sourceforge.net/ here at the SourceForge website ]
