==OBI Branch Development==

The development of an Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) has been divided into branches which were segregated into carefully selected non-overlapping areas of interest which would be modelled.  Each Branch has an assigned group of editors that oversee the development of a given branch.

An introduction to OBI can be found [http://obi.sourceforge.net/ at the SourceForge website] 
See the [[ObiBranches|branch outline]] for details on the branch development plan including roles and responsibilities.

==List of OBI Branches and Branch Reports==
The branches within OBI correspond to areas of interest to biomedical investigation.  These development branches are constituents of the OBI ontology, each having a specific domain scope detailing the specific area that they represent.  The branches are as follows: <br>

* [[BiomaterialTermNeeds |Biomaterial]] (lead editors: Susanna Sansone and Melanie Courtot), latest Report on: 
* [[DataTransformation |Data Transformation]] (Tina Boussard and James Malone), latest Report on: http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dm9czrk_5dcn65ffw
* [[DigitalEntityTerms |Digitial Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity (DENRIE)]] (Chris Stoeckert), latest Report on: http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dzprnmw_40fgg4ksf9
* [[FunctionTerms |Function]] (Bill Bug), latest Report on:
* [[InstrumentTerms |Instrument]] (Daniel Schober), latest Report on: http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg9kgrmp_2f447dkgf
* [[PlanBranch |Plan (investigation design - protocol)]] (Philippe Rocca-Serra), latest Report on:
* [[ProtocolApplicationBranch |Protocol Application]] (Bjoern Peters), latest Report on:
* [[QualitiesBranch |Qualities]] (Chris Mungall), latest Report on: http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dzprnmw_42f9mk6vdn
* [[RoleTerms |Role]] (Jennifer Fostel), latest Report on:
* [[ListOfRelationships |Relations]] (Liju Fan), latest Report on:

Each branch is assigned a group of editors which are responsible for the design and development of the terms, structure and hierarchy.  Mailing lists, weekly conference calls and regular face-to-face meetings are used to progress the development of each branch in a collaborative and cooperative manner.  An introduction to OBI can be found [http://obi.sourceforge.net/ here at the SourceForge website ]

==List of OBI Branch ID ranges==

As of February 2008, assigning IDs to OBI terms has become an automated process which is performed on the ontology before each official release.  Previous (now depricated) details on branch ranges can be found here
https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/AutoIDcommunityRanges

==Link to Minimal Metadata Information==
* List of minimal metadata to add for terms: [[MinimalMetadata]]

==List of OBI Identifiers for Each Branch==
*An initial set of identifiers was used during early development.  This has now been replaced by an automated single renaming strategy which is performed before each release.

==Latest Branch OWL Files==

Links to the latest list of terms for each branch can be found in the table below.  Note: as this is currently active work these links are likely to change over time.
