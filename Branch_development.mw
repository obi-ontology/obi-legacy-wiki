==OBI Branch Development==

The development of an Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) has been divided into branches which were segregated into carefully selected non-overlapping areas of interest which would be modelled.  Each Branch has an assigned group of editors that oversee the development of a given branch.  Here is a view of the ObiBranchDevelopment workflow [[]].

An introduction to OBI can be found [http://obi.sourceforge.net/ at the SourceForge website] 
See the [[ObiBranches|branch outline]] for details on the branch development plan including roles and responsibilities.

==List of OBI Branches==
The branches within OBI correspond to areas of interest to biomedical investigation.  These development branches are constituents of the OBI ontology, each having a specific domain scope detailing the specific area that they represent.  The branches are as follows: <br>

* [[BiomaterialTermNeeds |Biomaterial]] (lead editors: Susanna Sansone and Melanie Courtot)
* [[DataTransformation |Data Transformation]] (Tina Boussard and James Malone)
* [[DigitalEntityTerms |Digitial Entity and Non-realizable Information Entity (DENRIE)]] (Chris Stoeckert)
* [[FunctionTerms |Function]] (Bill Bug)
* [[InstrumentTerms |Instrument]] (Daniel Schober)
* [[PlanBranch |Plan (investigation design - protocol)]] (Philippe Rocca-Serra)
* [[ProtocolApplicationBranch |Protocol Application]] (Bjoern Peters)
* [[QualitiesBranch |Qualities]] (Chris Mungall)
* [[RoleTerms |Role]] (Jennifer Fostel)
* [[ListOfRelationships |Relations]] (Liju Fan)

Each branch is assigned a group of editors which are responsible for the design and development of the terms, structure and hierarchy.  Mailing lists, weekly conference calls and regular face-to-face meetings are used to progress the development of each branch in a collaborative and cooperative manner.  An introduction to OBI can be found [http://obi.sourceforge.net/ here at the SourceForge website ]
