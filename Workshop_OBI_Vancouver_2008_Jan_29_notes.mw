==Tuesday Jan 29 Notes==

Emerging Action Items:

<b>AI: Term problem solution sheet to be generated by RB to be sent to advisors if needed</b>

<b>AI: Develop a documentation plan for OBI and assign tasks JM/MC/BB. Deadline for docs and plan by March 1</b>

<b>AI: Branch/Individual review of other branches by March - all

AI: Develop a test plan for the OBI release, document and execute BB

AI:Take use cases and see if OBI can be used to complete these use cases, need some kind of template:

</b>

* RS:Volunteer to do a use case clinical study

* RB:Flow cytometry use case

* JM/HP:AE

* PRS/BII use case

* BB:BIRN use case

* JG:Immunity use case

======================================================================================

<b>Agenda</b>

Each branch will be allocated one hour for discussion. If some time remains at the end of these 2 days we can come back on some of them.

          o Problems without suggestions reviewed by group, then advisors 
    * Use cases worked out through OBI to demonstrate "it works"
    * Versioning policy (and other OBO Foundry requirements http://obofoundry.org/crit.shtml)

=========================================================================================
RB:Issues with branch development, easy to find things that are wrong, better to generate solutions. Proposal in AI below.

<b>AI: Term problem solution sheet to be generated by RB to be sent to advisors if needed</b>

RB:problem that we don't have any tools in the short term for naive users, but docs will help us

RS:We need a user documentation plan, and assign people tasks 

HP:what's the deadline for the release?

RB:deadline for wrapping up issues at this workshop is March 1, by end of the week we'll decide on a release date

BB:Test plan, 

<b>AI: Develop a documentation plan for OBI and assign tasks JM/MC/BB</b>

<b>AI: Develop a test plan for the OBI release, document and execute BB<b>

SS:If I need to add terms in the short term, how do I deal with that?

BP:We need the terms that work for cross branch terms

RB:I would say I need this, and offer a solution

RS:useful if you add to existing h'archy for the other branches

SS:do we use the tracker

RS:Volunteer to do a use case clinical study

RB:Flow cytometry use case

JM/HP:AE

PRS/BII use case

BB:BIRN use case

JG:Immunity use case

HP:What will be the format?

RB:Protege not the first tool that people will need to use

BP:Free text query and translation into OBI terms

AR:Could put them into my triple store. What is the goal?

RB:We want people to start using OBI, and we need to show what OBI is useful for

JM:We are identifying a different user group here

HP:I liked the mapping of the spreadsheet from RS and the use case translation from Bjoern, these are good representations

SS:I think we are mixing two things, showing what OBI could be used for, and we show ourselves  for the next workshop, then we can use for other people. I want to work on what I need.

RS:I was thinking making sure that the high level content was there

HP:I think we need to do this for us as internal review and then put it out there, we need to do this.
