This page is created for the developers of OBI whenever there is a need to vote over action items or any other topic related to OBI. This page only shows current votes, check the [[votes_results | results votes page]] for decisions on past votes.

We need a decision on what use case to work on to demonstrate usefulness of OBI. Two proposals exist:

1) Export data from different resources (e.g. IEDB, MAGE-TAB files, ...) into OWL instances, and then perform a cross resource query in OWL. 

2) Use OBI as GO-evidence code replacement, and allow to query for gene functions derived from e.g. human vs. mouse experiments 

Please put your vote below. Multiple votes possible if okay with either: 

1) BP; RB; AR

2) PRS; SAS
