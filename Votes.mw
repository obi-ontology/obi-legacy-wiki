== LICENSE for OBI ontology  2/24/2014 ==
It is currently not clearly indicated what license is used to distribute OBI. There is an ongoing discussion in the foundry which licenses should be supported. But everyone seems fine with CC-by 3.0 being one of them. We need to clarify this as part of our response to the foundry review. Vote is open until 3/10.  

In favor: 
BP, JO, RB, AR, CS, JZ, PRS, MC, YOH

== BFO for OBI ontology  3/3/2014 ==
