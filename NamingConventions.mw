'''Naming Conventions'''

A guidance document entitled '''Towards naming conventions for use in controlled vocabulary and ontology engineering''' has been developed by the Metabolomics Standards Society - Ontology Working Group, in collaboration with the OBO-Foundry. Initially it intended to cover the needs of the following groups:
* Metabolomics Standards Initioative (MSI)
* Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI)
* Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI)
Ultimately we hope that in its final form these naming conventions will be widely endorsed by larger umbrella organizations and recognized authorities, becoming part of OBO Foundry best practice design principles. 
Find the actual naming conventions on the OBO Foundry wiki at http://obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Naming

Initial recommendations and best practices have been published in the conference proceedings http://bio-ontologies.org.uk/download/Bio-Ontologies2007.pdf and on the website of the Bio-Ontology SIG at ISMB 2007. 

  * Comments or questions on naming issues should be sent to schober [[at]] ebi.ac.uk directly or to the OBI developers mailing lists.
