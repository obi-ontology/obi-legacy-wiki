==How do we specify solute concentration in OBI using BFO + OBO-RO + PATO==

There are typically two ways in which concentration is important to the experimental descriptions OBI will need to support:

# Concentration of a particular set of solutes is fed into an experiment as a part of an assay or material transformation - e.g.:
#* incubate this set of materials in a saline buffer composed of these solute concentrations
#* set the pH of your electrophysiological recording saline to X

# Concentration of a particular solute is the output of an assay - e.g.:
#* the concentration of protein in this solution
#* the concentration of glucose in this blood sample

How can we build formal descriptions for capturing concentration both as a description of a planned process/protocol, as well as the information content entity output of an assay?

I don't see how this differs from the Alan Rector solution
That is, in Case 2: There is no zinc in the sample. What does 'ZincConcentration2' represent?

That was my concern with the current example as drawn.  The definition of concentration does not REQUIRE an "of-sovlent" relation.  It only says that when a concentration quality has a "of-solvent" relation, it MUST be to a material.  My sense was this was essentially equivalent to the current "ro:towards" relation used to specified "pato:concentration of" what.  In other words, a Concentration MUST have a "in-solvent" relation but doesn't have to have an "of-solvent" relation.  Of course, it then has NO WAY of linking back to the solute material it is intended to be reporting on.

We need to refine this representation so that it:
	1) Copes well with the "lacks" case (i.e., concentration less than the sensitivity of the assay used)
	2) Can do so in a way that makes the link back to concentration of WHAT explicit
	3) Doesn't lead to the explosion of "no concentration of X" qualities.
