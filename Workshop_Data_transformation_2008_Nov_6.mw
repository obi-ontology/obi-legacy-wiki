==Action Items Day 4==

<b>AI:Add SNP and LOH methods/processes to dt - DT branch

AI:LOHPaired module - needs paper checking for what is implemented so we can assign a general algorithm and specific ones - MM

AI:Merge needs to be added as an objective synonym  - combine - JM
Definition: the union of two or more sets. E.g. the merging of columns or merging of rows from two different tab-delimited data sets.

AI:Add selection - e.g. selection based on row or column ids after merge.
Def:Selection is the objective of choosing data based on some criteria such as row or column identifiers. - Add to OWL file. JM

AI:We will need to add union, intersection, complement - JM

AI:Add mutual information  to OBI - def: a formula (borrowed from information theory) that compares the probability that two items occur together as a joint event with the probability that they occur individually (and that their co-occurances are a result of chance). Needs a placement in OBI - should live with correlation - MM

AI:add fold-change - process of calculating to OBI and define - JM

AI:define NMF currently u/c and add objectives - A pattern recognition algorithm that ids patterns that together explain the data as a linear combinatio of expression signatures. Synonyms:SY  - NCIT. Citation needs adding to NCIT - TL

AI:Make the objectives precise e.g. data selection - JM

AI:Check the NCIT for several alg definitions present there - DT branch

AI:Add warping as a synonym for alignment objective - JM

AI:Put the lsids back in the GenePattern use case file as names change - JM/TL

AI:Special kind of warping or possibly normalization (if we can agree that these are the same thing last resolution is that warping isn't a correction for systematic error) - Warping can be many to 1 or 1:1 for many:1 we need to add Discretization objective - Discretization objective is the approximation the solution of a continuous problem by representing it in terms of a discrete set of elements - JM. Synonym - bucketing, binning. Some reln to normalization but we cannot define this ontologically

AI:thresholding: Thresholding objective is a special kind of filtering where boundaries for minimum and maximum values are determined and the values that do not meet these criteria are removed.  Add as a child of filtering - JM

AI:Quality assessment to add - QC is a thing you do to have quality. Outlier id is a part of QA, but not a synonym. 

AI:Add outlier added as a role. MC

AI:Add survival analysis objective, and add cox regression, move Kaplan Meyer under this - TB

AI:Address longitidunal data sets in DT  - DT branch

AI:Add 'test for trend' to OBI

AI:Add cox regression

AI:add multivariate analysis of variance

AI:Longitudinal analysis and define it - change to objective 

AI:Document these use cases
Use case: longitudinal analysis - show me the methods show me the methods I can use- consider modelling as part of data, rather than in the heirarchy
Use case: longitudinal analysis response variable=time - show me the methods I can use

AI:design decision - we will use feature to say things like 'normally distributed' - about data
as a workaround for now. 

AI:Implement feature - normally distributed in OBI and apply to a process.

AI:Check Ricardo's slides and create a competency question per path

AI:Check R's slides and check all tests are present

==Continuing with Ted's use cases==

<b>AI:Add SNP and LOH methods/processes to dt - DT branch</b>

<b>AI:define NMF currently u/c and add objectives - A pattern recognition algorithm that ids patterns that together explain the data as a linear combinatio of expression signatures. Synonyms:SY  - NCIT. Citation needs adding to NCIT TL</b>

RS:reduction, selection etc - these will appear elsewhere in the ontology - there will be different types of discovery, or selection. These can be added as more generic objectives under objective. 

<b>AI:Make the objectives precise e.g. data selection - JM</b>

<b>AI:Check the NCIT for several alg definitions present there - DT branch</b>

Discussion on warping - if this is a synonym of feature alignment or a child. Warping has two steps, select feature and then align or warp based on these, but can be part of the same tool and also performed as two separate steps. 

<b>AI:Add warping as a synonym for aligment objective</b>


RB:Are selecting or discovering and identifying two different things. 

TB:In a protocol recruit the people, then ask their age.

<b>AI:Put the lsids back in the GenePattern use case file as names change </b>

<b>AI:Special kind of warping or possibly normalization (if we can agree that these are the same thing last resolution is that warping isn't a correction for systematic error) - Warping can be many to 1 or 1:1 for many:1 we need to add Discretization objective - Discretization objective is the approximation the solution of a continuous problem by representing it in terms of a discrete set of elements - JM.

Discussion on Thresholding. We need to distinguish between floor, ceiling, cutting off, or modifying the samples value. Two types of thresholding meaning - cut out where a threshold, or transform where there's a threshold met.

<b>AI:thresholding: Thresholding objective is a special kind of filtering where boundaries for minimum and maximum values are determined and the values that do not meet these criteria are removed.  Add as a child of filtering - JM

TL:min change filtering, fold change filtering 

<b>AI:Add two new types of filtering min change filtering and fold change filtering as child of filtering </b>

Quality assessment - in the case of ProteomicsAnalysis this is about removing features that don't meet the criteria - whatever they are. 

RB:QA can also be outlier identification (part of QA) - filtering comes after. 

AI:Quality assessment - QC is a thing you do to have quality. Outlier id is a part of QA, but not a synonym.

AI:Add outlier added as a role. MC

AI:Add survival analysis objective, and add cox regression, move kaplan meyer under this

AI:Address longitidunal data sets in DT  - DT branch


==Mini software use case==

Representing a sw that implements an algorithm or method.

Example GenePattern - 



Simple case
CART module from GenePattern that implements the process of CART. Has a single objective
http://www.broad.mit.edu/webservices/gpModuleRepository/download/prod/module/?file=/CART/broad.mit.edu:cancer.software.genepattern.module.analysis/00056/2/CART.pdf



Complex GenePattern case

PreprocessDataSet - GenePattern module which performs various preprocessing operations: thresholding, filtering, discretization, normalization. DT should capture the individual operations. Filtering is captured, at least in generality, under subclasses of dimensionality reduction, and various normalizations are already captured. Might want to add terms for thresholding and discretization. Also need to capture filtering criteria somewhere (parameter/feature?).

Documentation - http://www.broad.mit.edu/webservices/gpModuleRepository/download/prod/module/?file=/ProteoArray/broad.mit.edu:cancer.software.genepattern.module.analysis/00068/1/ProteoArray.pdf
 

TL:use case where have parameters for an sw implementation e.g CART - and the parametervalues instantiated when run the implementation (inputs to the process). So need a way to have parameters that relate to an objective where there are many methods implemented.

CONCERN:Two sub cases, implement an algorithm by 2 different softwares but things that GenePattern param are hard coded and therefore different implementation will not be directly comparable in terms of parameters. Like to have a generic definition of 'common parameter's than can be mapped between implementations where this can be done. Where x and y parameters = the input data for the clustering.

QUERY USE CASE:

If I know an algorithm e.g. CART tell me which SW implements it and what the input is for the SW that implements this.

SW has  properties (imcomplete), where it is URI , if it's open source, manufacturer, access - GUI, Web services
