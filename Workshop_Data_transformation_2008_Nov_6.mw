==Continuing with Ted's use cases==

<b>AI:Add SNP and LOH methods/processes to dt - DT branch</b>

<b>AI:LOHPaired module - needs paper checking for what is implemented so we can assign a general algorithm and specific ones - MM</b>

<b>AI:Merge needs to be added as an objective synonym  - combine - JM
Definition: the union of two or more sets. E.g. the merging of columns or merging of rows from two different tab-delimited data sets.</b>

<b>AI:Add selection - e.g. selection based on row or column ids after merge.
Def:Selection is the objective of choosing data based on some criteria such as row or column identifiers. - Add to OWL file. JM</b>

<b>AI:We will need to add union, intersection, complement - JM</b>

<b>Add mutual information  to OBI - def: a formula (borrowed from information theory) that compares the probability that two items occur together as a joint event with the probability that they occur individually (and that their co-occurances are a result of chance). Needs a placement in OBI - should live with correlation</b> - MM

<b>AI:add fold-change - process of calculating to OBI and define - JM</b>
<b>AI:define NMF currently u/c and add objectives - A pattern recognition algorithm that ids patterns that together explain the data as a linear combinatio of expression signatures. Synonyms:SY  - NCIT. Citation needs adding to NCIT TL</b>

RS:reduction, selection etc - these will appear elsewhere in the ontology - there will be different types of discovery, or selection. These can be added as more generic objectives under objective. 

<b>AI:Make the objectives precise e.g. data selection - JM</b>

<b>AI:Check the NCIT for several alg definitions present there - DT branch</b>

Discussion on warping - if this is a synonym of feature alignment or a child. Warping has two steps, select feature and then align or warp based on these, but can be part of the same tool and also performed as two separate steps. 

<b>AI:Add warping as a synonym for aligment objective</b>


RB:Are selecting or discovering and identifying two different things. 

TB:In a protocol recruit the people, then ask their age.

<b>AI:Put the lsids back in the GenePattern use case file as names change </b>

<b>AI:Special kind of warping or possibly normalization (if we can agree that these are the same thing last resolution is that warping isn't a correction for systematic error) - Warping can be many to 1 or 1:1 for many:1 we need to add Discretization objective - Discretization objective is the approximation the solution of a continuous problem by representing it in terms of a discrete set of elements - JM. Synonym - bucketing, binning. Some reln to normalization but we cannot define this ontologically</b>


Discussion on Thresholding. We need to distinguish between floor, ceiling, cutting off, or modifying the samples value. Two types of thresholding meaning - cut out where a threshold, or transform where there's a threshold met.

<b>AI:thresholding: Thresholding objective is a special kind of filtering where boundaries for minimum and maximum values are determined and the values that do not meet these criteria are removed.  Add as a child of filtering - JM
