<b>AI:Add SNP and LOH methods/processes to dt - DT branch</b>

<b>AI:LOHPaired module - needs paper checking for what is implemented so we can assign a general algorithm and specific ones - MM</b>

<b>AI:Merge needs to be added as an objective synonym  - combine - JM
Definition: the union of two or more sets. E.g. the merging of columns or merging of rows from two different tab-delimited data sets.</b>

Def:Selection is the objective of choosing data based on some criteria such as row or column identifiers. - Add to OWL file. JM</b>

<b>AI:We will need to add union, intersection, complement - JM</b>

<b>Add mutual information  to OBI - def: a formula (borrowed from information theory) that compares the probability that two items occur together as a joint event with the probability that they occur individually (and that their co-occurances are a result of chance). Needs a placement in OBI - should live with correlation</b> - MM

<b>AI:add fold-change - process of calculating to OBI and define - JM</b>

<b>AI:define NMF currently u/c and add objectives - TL</b>
