The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) project is developing an integrated ontology for the description of life-science and clinical investigations.

'''What is it?'''

The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) project is developing an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical investigations. This includes a set of 'universal' terms, that are applicable across various biological and technological domains, and domain-specific terms relevant only to a given domain. This ontology will support the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. The ontology will represent the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type analysis performed on it. Currently OBI is being built under the Basic Formal Ontology [http://www.ifomis.org/bfo (BFO)].

*Develop an Ontology for Biomedical Investigations in collaboration with groups representing different biological and technological domains involved in Biomedical Investigations
*Make OBI compatible with other bio-ontologies
*Develop OBI using an open source approach
*Create a valuable resource for the biomedical communities to provide a source of terms for consistent annotation of investigations

'''Who is OBI?'''

The OBI project is an international, collaborative effort to build an ontology to be used for annotation of Biomedical Investigations. The [[Consortium|OBI Consortium]] is the name under which the OBI project authors its work.

'''Talk with us'''

We have [[Mailing_lists| mailing lists]] for both users and developers. Join the users list to be notified of each OBI release. If you represent a Community that would like to collaborate in the development of OBI, contact the [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/obi-coord Coordination Committee].

'''Conference Calls'''

Weekly Developer Working Group conference calls are held on Wednesdays from 11-12AM EST, 4-5PM GMT, with the exception of the second Wednesday of each month. For more information on these calls, check [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/ConferenceCallAgenda the conference call agenda]. 

'''Report bugs'''

Visit our [http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi/tracker issue tracker] to report problems or submit terms for inclusion, and to track their resolution.

'''Contribute to the software effort'''

Our [http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi/repository subversion repository] is open for perusal. The OBI [http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi/calendar calendar] lists the regular branch calls and face-to-face developers meetings.
