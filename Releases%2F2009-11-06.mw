Placeholder for the 'release 1' release candidate release notes.


rc1.0 =

1. all terms assigned an obi id

2. not all annotation properties will be turned into instances (scripting needed, takes time)

3. priority 9 trackers in IAO and OBI fixed

4. remove obsolete terms to a sep file which can be imported (not by default)

5. _placeholder fixed, there will be no _ prefix OBI classes in rc1.0. Any top _ level
classes were scripted out and will continue to be so

6. All obi terms will have a curation status (not imports)

7. rc1.0 will be inferred and disjoint

8. rc1.0 will be released to obo foundry and bioportal, purls will change  bioportal doesn't include imports, we want them to see these and will produce a special version for them, and we will ask that they do not serve this version for download. This will be a one off. We expect ncbo will fix this for our next release.

CS will follow up with ncbo. MC/AR will send an email with the background to CS.

9. rc1.0 will include release notes and documentation - HP will coordinate

10. we will not produce an obo version for rc1.0

11. we will not produce an html version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks:

1. finish _placeholder classes clean up - goal all _ prefix classes removed, children resolved - tracker items describe these (priority 9, Helen and James) - 22nd October

2. ensure all OBI terms (not Imports) have curation status attached (needs checking) - Melanie will run script - 22nd October

3. scripted changes -  blocker -  AR/MC/JZ

Release process needs adjusting, needs to reason inside lisp, may need extra code for re-assigning ids (if doesn't reason in lisp)
* strip out obsolete classes, add disjoints etc
* count classes etc

* aim to complete by 6 November

4. necessary IAO changes, submitted to IAO tracker as critical priority AR/MC 30 October

5. check all the remaining priority 9 and 8 tracker items done by 30 October

6. Editing freeze for release process to start 30 October
