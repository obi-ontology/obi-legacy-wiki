==Data Transformation Action Items By Person/Task==

==Editing Tasks - James Malone/Melanie Courtot==


AI:Hammer BFO/IO for answers on where variables will be in the ontology. Add this to the agenda for Vancouver. MC

AI:'center calculation' and 'averaging data transformation' defined classes need attention. MM thinks that these could be conflated. Moving average needs to be under both. Data imputation possibly incorrect - could be a class in itself. Need a new defined class for that - probably objective. 

AI:Background correction - changes to an objective. 

AI:Change 'data partitioning' to an objective

AI:gating is not a dimensionality reduction and is therefore incorrectly placed under property based vector reduction - PBVR. Gating has objective data partioning, goes under the root. PBVR -  was this created so that gating will fall into the hierarchy? Send an email Richard to describe the issue and see if he is happy with this proposal  - MC - DONE. RS is Happy 

AI:Address dimensionality reduction vs. data vector reduction - if these are the same thing - then we can have a single term for both. - MC will also add this to the email.

AI:create a sheet for variables as these determine what test you do -DONE and submitted to IAO - DONE, discussion with AR

AI:Descriptive stats also becomes an objective

AI:Need defintion for Ward's method under agglomerative h'arch clustering - MC

AI:Differential expression analysis becomes an objective - as any test can be used - this is the objective

AI:Discriminant analysis should be a synonym of classification or class discovery MM

AI:EH transformation - belongs where B transformation is sibling - B/H/EH/S transformations should have objective normalization

AI: Feature extraction suggested to be made an objective as suggested in review.

AI:Loess scale group transformation is a scaling adjustment. CHange tree to reflect this. Just the scaling, not the transformation. Add a scaling objective will be added, loess scale gp trans is-a loess group transformation, followed by a scaling adjustment. This will be a defined class  - any dt with objective scaling.

AI:JM will email Elisabetta offline to ask about MA transformation's objective.

AI:We need a new objective - 'Type 1 Error Rate correction'

AI:Add a synonym to Network analysis - network topology analysis. 

AI:Send an email to RS about Network analysis's objectives

AI:Find out what WAS classified under polynomial transformation (in some previous version) - need to have a property that is associated with it somehow.

AI: Sequence analysis becomes and objective, anything underneath will have it as an objective. Objective is 'sequence feature identification' or 'prediction'


AI: SMCA - is an normalization objective



===Tina Boussard's Tasks===

===Monnie McGee's Tasks===

AI:Add CART random forest  to OBI MM will define

AI:Def trimmed mean calc - has part trimming process, suceeded by mean calculation.
Outlier removal to be added as an objective.  MM

AI:MM will ask a colleague what to do for 3D and 2D feature extraction and if they are different.

AI:MM will look to see whether other scaling adjustments are used instead of loess ever.

===Ryan Brinkman's Tasks===

AI:Find information for B transformation (existing term) - need an objective. - RB

AI: Add QT clustering - RB will define 

AI:Add feature selection - objective. RB In this sense doing machine learning as in wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection - RB. Random forests should be under feature 

AI:Need some way to relate multiple testing with the need for multiple test correction RB has a use case
selection.


===Ted Liefeld's Tasks===

===Ricardo Pietrobon's Tasks===

===Philippe Rocca-Serra's Tasks===

AI:PRS will go back and check the objective for 'soft independent modeling of class analogy analysis'

AI:We will ask the metagenomic community for a use case (about sequence alignment?  We will work on this when we have use cases for these PRS


===General Data Transformation Branch Tasks===

AI:Follow up on input/output lists for Zelig - with Amrupali - DT branch

AI:Need to add the fuzzy clustering methods -
http://home.dei.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/cmeans.html

AI:Review branch to check for missing subsumption of terms for objectives

AI:Add more children for specific methods of multiple testing procedure.
