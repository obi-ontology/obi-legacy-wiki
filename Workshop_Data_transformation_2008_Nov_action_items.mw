==Data Transformation Action Items By Person/Task==

==Editing Tasks - James Malone/Melanie Courtot==


AI:Hammer BFO/IO for answers on where variables will be in the ontology. Add this to the agenda for Vancouver. MC

AI:'center calculation' and 'averaging data transformation' defined classes need attention. MM thinks that these could be conflated. Moving average needs to be under both. Data imputation possibly incorrect - could be a class in itself. Need a new defined class for that - probably objective. 

AI:Background correction - changes to an objective. 

AI:Change 'data partitioning' to an objective

AI:gating is not a dimensionality reduction and is therefore incorrectly placed under property based vector reduction - PBVR. Gating has objective data partioning, goes under the root. PBVR -  was this created so that gating will fall into the hierarchy? Send an email Richard to describe the issue and see if he is happy with this proposal  - MC - DONE. RS is Happy 

AI:Address dimensionality reduction vs. data vector reduction - if these are the same thing - then we can have a single term for both. - MC will also add this to the email.

AI:create a sheet for variables as these determine what test you do -DONE and submitted to IAO - DONE, discussion with AR

AI:Descriptive stats also becomes an objective

AI:Need defintion for Ward's method under agglomerative h'arch clustering - MC

AI:Differential expression analysis becomes an objective - as any test can be used - this is the objective

AI:Discriminant analysis should be a synonym of classification or class discovery MM

AI:EH transformation - belongs where B transformation is sibling - B/H/EH/S transformations should have objective normalization

AI: Feature extraction suggested to be made an objective as suggested in review.

AI:Loess scale group transformation is a scaling adjustment. CHange tree to reflect this. Just the scaling, not the transformation. Add a scaling objective will be added, loess scale gp trans is-a loess group transformation, followed by a scaling adjustment. This will be a defined class  - any dt with objective scaling.

AI:JM will email Elisabetta offline to ask about MA transformation's objective.

AI:We need a new objective - 'Type 1 Error Rate correction'

AI:Add a synonym to Network analysis - network topology analysis. 

AI:Send an email to RS about Network analysis's objectives

AI:Find out what WAS classified under polynomial transformation (in some previous version) - need to have a property that is associated with it somehow.

AI: Sequence analysis becomes and objective, anything underneath will have it as an objective. Objective is 'sequence feature identification' or 'prediction'

AI: SMCA - is an normalization objective

AI:Add 'cross validation' as an objective - JM (added to s/sheet)




===Tina Boussard's Tasks===

AI:Add cross correlation as a term - generic term will be cross correlation, needs an objective.


===Monnie McGee's Tasks===

AI:Add CART random forest  to OBI MM will define

AI:Def trimmed mean calc - has part trimming process, suceeded by mean calculation.
Outlier removal to be added as an objective.  MM

AI:MM will ask a colleague what to do for 3D and 2D feature extraction and if they are different.

AI:MM will look to see whether other scaling adjustments are used instead of loess ever.

AI:look up other types of chi squared and define them MM

AI:quantitative variable - we need a definition that separates from ordinal - MM

AI: LandmarkMatch, LocatePeaks relate to proteomics. May related to the sequence of the data - MM will investigate these 

AI: Add a subclass for GSEA on differential expression excercise. MM


===Ryan Brinkman's Tasks===

AI:Find information for B transformation (existing term) - need an objective. - RB

AI: Add QT clustering - RB will define 

AI:Add feature selection - objective. RB In this sense doing machine learning as in wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection - RB. Random forests should be under feature 

AI:Need some way to relate multiple testing with the need for multiple test correction RB has a use case
selection.



===Ted Liefeld's Tasks===

AI:Add a link to Teds tools that assist users with which tool to use under which cases, we could build this into the ontology later - TL/DT branch

AI:GenePattern's Compare spectra, is a comparison again, we need info about the implementation to do more than add the objective for this to the sheet. -TL

AI:GenePattern has a list of what was run most frequently, we will use these to determine focus for GenePattern support

AI:We need Features - where features are discriminant between samples - feature selection objective. COmparativeMarkerSelection. Also need to add markers to the role branch where a marker is a synonym of feature. - follow up with TL.

AI:Add a link to Teds tools that assist users with which tool to use under which cases, we could build this into the ontology later - TL/DT branch


===Ricardo Pietrobon's Tasks===

AI: Alt term:categorical variable. Needs two child terms: dichotomous variable, polychotomous variable and definitions - RP

AI:Dump out the definitions of the variables used at Duke - these are defined in templates RP
 - DONE, available as a google doc.

===Philippe Rocca-Serra's Tasks===

AI:PRS will go back and check the objective for 'soft independent modeling of class analogy analysis'

AI:We will ask the metagenomic community for a use case (about sequence alignment?  We will work on this when we have use cases for these PRS

AI:Methods will be proposed from relevant terms in the header row of the hypothesis test spreadsheet to the plan/planned process branch. PRS



===General Data Transformation Branch Tasks===

AI:Follow up on input/output lists for Zelig - with Amrupali - DT branch

AI:Need to add the fuzzy clustering methods -
http://home.dei.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/cmeans.html

AI:Review branch to check for missing subsumption of terms for objectives

AI:Add more children for specific methods of multiple testing procedure.

AI:Need to deal with annotation where we map to ids only e.g add GO terms, where we add annotation value also for case of GenePattern module - Hu68kHu35kAtoU95 - is this in data transformation or not? 

AI:RMA, GC-RMA, MAS5 - need to be added somewhere - with algorithm

AI:Look at the categorization in GenePattern UI and check vs. the current OBI objectives, should be some concordance

AI:Need to add distance measures in the ontology. We need to add these to the list Euclidean distance. Problem that we don't know where to put these yet. Where's the list?- Branch Work

AI:Add pattern matching (class neighbours) as an objective - DT branch. We need a generic algorithm for this. We think KNN is the closest thing to a generic algorithm for this, where K=2. Checking about how this is implemented in GenePattern


===Unassigned===

AI:GenePatterns need parameters as well as analysis methods, need to add these as a wish list items.


AI:Add BIC - bayesian info criteria - way to determine a number that will determine cluster numbers, AIC, ICL, to be added as new terms. Related GenePattern ConsenusClustering
