== About this ontology ==
 
The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) project has developed an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical investigations. This includes a set of 'universal' terms, that are applicable across various biological and technological domains, and domain-specific terms relevant only to a given domain. This ontology supports the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. The ontology represents the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type analysis performed on it. OBI is being built under the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and imports terms from OBO foundry ontologies. OBI also reflects domains specific extensions which were merged into obi.owl. These include terms merged into obi.owl from the Immune Epitope Database Ontology (www.ideb.org) and community suggested terms from many communities. 

Aims:

* Develop an Ontology for Biomedical Investigations in collaboration with groups representing different biological and technological domains involved in Biomedical Investigations
* Make OBI compatible with other bio-ontologies
* Develop OBI using an open source approach
* Create a valuable resource for the biomedical communities to provide a source of terms for consistent annotation of investigations 

More details at: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi

Further reading:  You can find the OBI manuscript which this version supports at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/repository/trunk/docs/papers/release/Manuscript.doc
 
== Ontology development ==

OBI Ontology Development is collaborative, term suggestions and new community representatives are welcome. Single term can be suggested via the OBI tracker http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/tracker. 

If you represent a community and/or have many terms to suggest please email OBI Developers <obi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> with details. If you would like to see the latest development version please check out the development copy of OBI from sourceforge. 

Tutorials on how to do this can be found here: http://obi-ontology.org/page/Tutorials

The OBI wiki can be found at: http://obi-ontology.org/

== How to contact us ==

Send emails with questions on how to use OBI to obi-users@googlegroups.com. You
can sign up for this group, or view the archives, at:
http://groups.google.com/group/obi-users

Discussion among OBI developers can be found at obi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. You
can sign up for this group, or view the archives, at:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/obi-devel or
http://groups.google.com/group/obi-developer

OBI term requests, as well as reports of bugs or other issues can be
entered in our tracker: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/tracker The
tracker currently requires you to have or sign up for a sourceforge
account. Please send an email to obi-users@googlegroups.com if this is
problematic.

== New to this OBI release ==
 
There are more changes since the last release than can be compactly described here. Users with questions are directed to the OBI users list.

Here are the highlight:
* OBO format of OBI is available for this version (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/obi.obo)

* 25 newly added classes

A total of 25 new classes (excluding the terms imported from external resources) were added to OBI in this release containing:
- terms to represent metadate of sample required by BRC
- types of binding assays and related terms such as binding measurement data required by the IEDB group

The newly added OBI classes are listed on http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/releases/2012-03-29/docs/newClasses.html

* fixed multiple asserted inheritance of NCBITaxon under organism branch caused by some errors occur during MIROET 

* A static url is given to OBI IEDB view, http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/obi_IEDBview.owl

== Obsolete classes in OBI ==

The obsoletion policy is described on the OBI wiki - http://obi-ontology.org/page/OBIDeprecationPolicy

OBI enforces a strict deprecation policy: OBI Identifiers in this release are stable and will be maintained in new versions.

== Known issues ==

* Without release version of IAO transited in BFO 2.0, the development version of IAO is merged to the current OBI release. 

<!--
* This release is available only in OWL format. There is no official OBO Format version at present: OBI cannot be loaded nor viewed in OBO-Edit and is not available from the Ontology Lookup Service at EBI. 
-->

== External ontology and resource mapping/imports list ==
 
The full list of ontologies and external resources from which one or more terms are imported into OBI via the MIREOT process ([http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3574/version/1/files/npre20093574-1.pdf Courtot et al. 2009 MIREOT: the Minimum Information to Reference an External Ontology Term.])[[http://iospress.metapress.com/content/h54m2237310v13x1/?p=2c64591d6d5e49aa928bb145c74c6ef4&pi=2 Ref]] is below.

* Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
* Gene Ontology (GO)
* Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO)
* Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)
