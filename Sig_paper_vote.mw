==Expansion of Bio-Ontologies SIG Paper for Journal Publication==

The OBI SIG paper has been invited for expansion and inclusion in a special edition of JBMS http://www.jbiomedsem.com/  As we are already writing a Journal paper for publication elsewhere, there is concern that this could end up as a distraction, delaying the release manuscript and may also require considerable work so that it aligns with the ontology correctly. Furthermore, there is a lack of interest from enough parties to actually do the work for this 2nd paper. With this in mind, we require a vote on the following, NOTE: the '''deadline for submission to JBMS is OCTOBER 18th'''. Please initial your choice:

'''Vote'''

'''Option 1: We should not write another Journal paper for JBMS'''

Initials: HP

'''Option 2^: We should write an extension paper. (if you vote for this see below)'''

Initials: JM


^If you voted option 2, please indicate if you would be willing to do work on this paper and in what capactiy (e.g. JM: Willing to write a use case).

Initials:

JM - can construct another DT use case I reckon
