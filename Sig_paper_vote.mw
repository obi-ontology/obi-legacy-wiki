==Expansion of Bio-Ontologies SIG Paper for Journal Publication==

The OBI SIG paper has been invited for expansion and inclusion in a special edition of JBMS http://www.jbiomedsem.com/  As we are already writing a Journal paper for publication elsewhere, there is concern that this could end up as a distraction, delaying the release manuscript and may also require considerable work so that it aligns with the ontology correctly. Furthermore, there is a lack of interest from enough parties to actually do the work for this 2nd paper. With this in mind, we require a vote on the following, NOTE: the '''deadline for submission to JBMS is OCTOBER 30th'''. Please initial your choice:

'''Vote'''

'''Option 1: We should not write another Journal paper for JBMS'''

Initials: HP (will help with SIG paper if outvoted), BP (but I am happy to be outvoted, and will then want to check on the content of the SIG paper)

'''Option 2^: We should write an extension paper. (if you vote for this see below)'''

Initials: JM, OH, JF, JZ, MC, RB, DD (as long as effort does not impact progress on bi-weekly calls/main paper), LSS, CS

'''The result: option 2 has won and we are working on the paper. Thank you very much to everyone! 

^If you voted option 2, please indicate if you would be willing to do work on this paper and in what capactiy (e.g. JM: Willing to write a use case). By <b>30 October 2009</b>



Initials:
<br\>JM - can construct another DT use case I reckon
<br\>OH - can actively work on it
<br\>JF - can contribute editing
<br\>JZ - can work on it for anything I can help
<br\>MC - happy to review and correct draft
<br\>RB - happy to review and correct draft
<br\>LSS- can actively work on it
<br \>DD - Can finish use case cognitive neuroscience - decision processing, (which I at one stage already sent to Melanie for review)
<br\>CS - happy to review and correct draft
<br\>DS - can work on it for anything I can help


''' Plan

* put description of proposed use cases to the SIG wiki page - '''by 29-09'''

* decide what we include into the paper: what use cases and what from the Methods section (the main manuscript, it will not be included there) and assign responsible for each section - '''by 5-10'''  
[the structure goes to SVN and everything after that].

* work on sections - by '''19-10.''' 

* 3 reviews/corrections - 2 days each  OR 2 reviews 3 days each - '''by 25th'''
[please put here your name and the dates when you are available for reviewing if you can help]

* put everything together and give it to all OBI people to comment - '''by 27-10''' [LSS]

* give your comments, corrections, suggestions - by '''29-10'''

* final corrections and submission - '''30-10''' [LSS]

== Use Case: Automated Functional Genomics ==

=== About the diagrams ===

'''In short:''' the experiment tries studies the role of the caudate nucleus in the control of action and more specifically targets the reward factor. It is found that the caudate nucleus is active before the actual presentation of the stimulus and fires more for the reward related position. 


I represented the '''following elements''' of the study:
* Study Design
* 1 subject: 'Monkey 1'
* Measurements and Stats
* Stimulus 'Left Cue'


=== Diagrams ===

'''Study Design'''

The experiment tries to unravel what the role is of the caudate nucleus in reward processing. The preparation is basically nothing else but the training of the monkey to respond to a particular reward schema. During the experiment, this reward schema was reversed. The activity of the caudate nucleus and the reaction times (speed of making a saccade) during this experiment were the measurements, which showed that the caudate nucleus was active even before the stimulus was presented.

'''Measurements'''

This represents the measurements of the experiments. I represented single unit recordings and reaction times. There is no direct access to the data, hence the figures are well represented in the diagram.

'''Subject'''

This represents the subject and its recording location. It as such does not hold a lot of information, yet it seems to be fairly easy to represent the available elements.

'''Stimulus 'Left Cue''''

This represents the stimulus "Left Cue'. A bit more detail than previous diagram, showing how detailed you can get using OBI.
