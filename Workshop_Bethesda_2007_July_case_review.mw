==[[ JulyWorkshopObiUseCaseReview |July Bethesda OBI Workshop - Use Case Review]]==

This page provides a general outline of the Use Cases we'd like to review at the meeting, a brief definition of Use Case in this context, and aggregates links to Use Cases from specific OBI Branch Use Case pages.

=== Use Case Scope and Definition ===

''<<We need to have a clear definition and statement of scope for these Use Cases, so all branches & communities can use this as a guide when assembling their Use Cases>>''


=== General Use Case Hierarchy ===
* Use of OBI within other ontologies
** [http://www.obofoundry.org/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?id=nmr NMR Instruments] (for metabolomics investigation)
** [http://purl.org/nbirn/birnlex/support BIRNLex] - from BIRN
* Representation of biomedical investigation instances - experiment provenance - referencing OBI elements
** Representation of biomedical investigation instances using current formats (XML Schemas, flat file formats, etc.) designed by specific communities for export/exchange of provenance data
*** gene expression studies
**** [http://fuge.sourceforge.net FuGE]
**** [http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MAGE/mage.html MicroArray and Gene Expression (MAGE)]
***** [http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MAGE/mage-ml.html v1.1]
***** [http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MAGE/magev2.html v2.0] (layered on top of FuGE)
*** bioimaging studies
**** [http://www.nbirn.net/downloads/xcede/index.shtm XML-based Clinical Experiment Data Exchange Schema (XCEDE)] (from BIRN)
**** [http://medical.nema.org Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)]
