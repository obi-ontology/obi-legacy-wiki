==Possible Issues To Discuss==

*General Housekeeping
# It would be useful if the major decsions and discussion points were recorded, with their justification, and published so those unable to attend the meeting can keep up to date.
# Discussion of Trish's proposed SOP document, including the importance of running reasoners from an early stage 
# High-level discussion of how the various OBI owl file(s) will look once mature (Matt can provide a document on the wiki that I can go through at the meeting).

*Metadata
#Change of annotation property 'example' from MUST to SHOULD be present (in Minimal Metadata)
#:I have issue with the use of example being mandatory, it is my understanding that that a decsion of a "filler" should be added if they could not come up with an example". This makes no sense to me. It is either mandatory and required, or optional and not required. It is not good practice to bypass it with a null value.
#:However the major issue is that very few, if any currently existing ontologies have examples. None of the PSI CVs do. You will not get anyone to systematically provide examples for 5000-odd terms in the PSI CVs. By making "example" mandatory you will exclude these resources and narrow your user base.
*Issues with Metadata Property Implementation Changes - due to changes for New SVN Branch set-up or Batch Term loading code
#Change of annotation properties from type DatatypeAnnotationProperty to AnnotationProperty
#:-this item is prompted by the change to the OWL files by Alan that subsequently broke the batch term loading code, tsk, tsk
#Change of annotation property curation_status from no longer being an enumerated list
#:-this item is prompted by a change made to the OWL files by Alan that appears to be contrary to the last discussion on the implementation of this as described on the MinimalMetadata wiki, tsk, tsk
#Including property rdfs:label as well as preferred_term property
#:-this is prompted by the unresolved discussion on this item and the fact that the batch term loading code is adding this as coded by Trish, tsk, tsk

*Modeling Issues
#How to use the reasoner to generate multiple inheritance that is acceptable (Look at 'Normalisation' as proposed by Alan Rector)
#Resolve how Company, Manufacturer names used as RU's will be represented
- Note: there are many ontologies which have tried to represent, companies and organisations. An example is [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=SEP sepCV] , loosely based on SUMO

*Community Usage of OBI

*Branch development/Ontology QA
#The curation_status flag, and using it in relations. I would like ask the relations branch to make use of the curation status flags on their relations, so we other branch users know when relations are stable or not.
#A spell-checker should be used on the branch files, prior to SVN check-in
#The definition_source values need to be checked to see if they are in the format requested on [[MinimalMetadata]]
-to me the word definition is confusing. An RU definition in the OWL world is the natural language definition the labels and the relations. My preference would be to use an annotation property called "description_source" to account for the Natural language description for a RU
