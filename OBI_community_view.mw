'''OBI community view'''

Several groups want to have a user friendly community version of OBI. Here is a collection of requirements how such a view should look like, and based on that, we will work on suggesting implementation mechanisms. 

A community view should: 

- be a subset of OBI classes, relations, and instances
- allow to overwrite preferred labels with community specific versions 
- reason without errors
- be released as the reasoned version
- be searchable by itself in e.g. Bioportal 
- be stable so that any updates to OBI / RO / BFO / etc. do not affect it
- be quick to update for a new version of OBI, resulting in a new community specific release

Implementations
Discussed so far were two approaches
- maintain spreadsheet with IDs, preferred labels
- maintain annotation properties in the OBI file
