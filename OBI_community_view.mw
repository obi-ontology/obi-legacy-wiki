'''OBI community view'''

Several groups want to have a user friendly community version of OBI. Here is a collection of requirements how such a view should look like, and based on that, we will work on suggesting implementation mechanisms. 

A community view should: 

 - be a subset of OBI classes, relations, and instances
 - allow to overwrite preferred labels with community specific versions 
 - reason without errors
 - be released as the reasoned version
 - be searchable by itself in e.g. Bioportal 
 - be stable so that any updates to OBI / RO / BFO / etc. do not affect it
 - be quick to update for a new version of OBI, resulting in a new community specific release

Implementations

Discussed so far were two approaches
 - maintain spreadsheet with IDs, preferred labels
 - maintain annotation properties in the OBI file
