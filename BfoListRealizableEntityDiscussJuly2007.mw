=BFO:Realizable Entity: Distinction between Disposition, Function, and Role=

This discussion thread took place on the BFO mailing list in July 2007.  It is summarized here, since it might provide us with a clearer sense of how to proceed with OBI:Function, which must build off one or more of these BFO realizable entity types.

===Alternative bfo:realizable_entity relations to better distinguish bfo:disposition, bfo:function, and bfo:role===
* '''MS''' - ''July 16, 2007 4:13:16 AM EDT''
** The distinction between realizable entities - '''disposition''', '''role''' and '''function''' - is unclear and causing problems for me and for others trying to use it.  
*** At least, you, Alan, and I have raised the problem ('''WK''' - ''July 16, 2007 7:01:13 AM EDT'')
** I now think distinguishing '''disposition''', '''role''' and '''function''' as separate, disjoint classes does more harm than good and might turn out to be a significant hindrance to interoperability between ontologies.
*** If used improperly, e.g., because of unclear definitions and examples, yes.  If used properly, why? ('''WK''' - ''July 16, 2007 7:01:13 AM EDT'')
** ''Proposal'':
*** I see '''role''' and '''function''' as subclasses of '''disposition''' -- they are types of '''disposition''' with some extra properties and constraints.
*** I see '''function''' as a subclass of '''role''' -- i.e. a '''function''' is a '''role''' an entity must play throughout the extent of its existence.
**** Just shuffling graph nodes won't help unless we provide a means to ''use'' the new classification you propose to meet our application needs.  I do not necessarily object to your solution, but it is vaguely stated.  Can you provide definitions + examples of the following:
****# '''disposition''' as subsumed by '''realizable_entity'''
****# '''role''' as subsumed by '''disposition'''
****# '''function''' as subsumed by '''role'''?
** ''Use Case'' - convert the [http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php}PDSP Ki database] to BFO / OWL
**** contains entries about receptor - ligand interactions. A typical entry consists of a receptor molecule, a ligand (binding) molecule and a Ki value (a measure for the affinity of the ligand for the receptor molecule)
**** Question: Is ligand binding:
***** disposition-to-bind
***** function-of-binding
***** role-of-binding
**** decided to just use '''bfo:realizable_entity''', as which you pick seems context-dependent and poorly specified.
** ''Question'': Is it correct to assume '''bfo:realizable_entity''' is a type designed to make statements about ''hypothetical processes'' without mentioning such ''hypothetical'' entities because they conflict with the realist world view of BFO?
*** If so, I see no reason to distinguish the entity ''function of heart to pump blood'' ('''bfo:function''' example) from ''role of artificial heart to pump blood'' ('''bfo:role''' example) when they are realized as similar processes.
*** I would rather create a more generic type of ''realizable_entity'' (let us call it '''potential_to_pump_blood''' here) and clarify the way it is realized through the relation linking the spectific type of '''bfo:independent_continuant''' to '''potential_to_pump_blood'''.
**** ''Example'': 
***** '''biological_heart''' would link to an instance of '''potential_to_pump_blood''' through the relation ''has_function''
***** '''artificial_heart''' would link to an instance of '''potential_to_pump_blood''' through the relation ''has_role''
***** avoids creating highly redundant, disjoint classes like '''function_to_pump_blood''' and '''role_to_pump_blood''', with the many associated risks of creating incompatible ontologies.
****** If you object to distinguishing '''disposition''', '''role''' and '''function''' (as you do above), what sense would it make to conflate them into '''potentials''' and then use the (supposedly equally ambiguous) relations ''has_role'', ''has_function'' etc. ('''WK''' - ''July 16, 2007 7:01:13 AM EDT'')
******* At least it would not necessitate creating three different, quite redundant, disjoint classes - i.e., '''disposition to X''', '''role of doing X''', '''function of doing X'''. ('''MS''' - ''July 17, 2007 9:31:47 AM EDT'')
******** ''Question'' ('''WK''' - ''July 17, 2007 9:58:50 AM EDT''): Do you propose creating subclasses of '''bfo:realizable_entity''' with no further detail, so that, for example, the '''potential''' (?) to pump blood would be represented as a '''realizable_entity''', but not as a '''bfo:function''' or '''bfo:role''', and you could thus say
********# (''has_function'' '''natural_heart''' '''pumping_blood_potential''')
********# (''has_role'' '''artificial_heart''' '''pumping_blood_potential''')
********* In other words, the realizable '''pumping_blood_potential''' has a '''disposition''' to play the '''role''' of a '''function''' or of a '''role'''  :)
********** '''AR''' - ''July 17, 2007 11:06:50 PM EDT''
*********** Well, more precisely (otherwise this was a trick question) something like:
************ (''has_potential'' '''natural_heart''' '''pumping_blood_potential''')
*********** I take this as the null hypothesis. If there is a further distinction to be made, then there should be some unambiguous criterion for making the further distinction.
********** '''BS''' - ''July 18, 2007 3:49:23 AM EDT''
*********** In both cases we are talking about a '''function'''; '''role''' involves a (usually socially mediated) element of voluntary ascription (e.g. the '''nurse''' '''role''', the '''student''' '''role'''); actually studying is not a matter of playing a '''role'''; being such as to have the ''potential'' to pump blood is not a matter of a '''role'''.
********* ''Answer'' ('''MS''' - ''July 17, 2007 6:55:05 PM EDT''): Yes
** ''Proposal'': These immediate bfo subclasses of '''bfo:realizable_entity''' should not be used and should ideally be removed from BFO.

===Improve defintions and examples to better distinguish bfo:disposition, bfo:function, and bfo:role===
* '''WK''' - ''July 16, 2007 7:01:13 AM EDT''
** Your suggestion to remove the distinction from BFO may be a bit overhasty;  remember BFO is a top-level ontology, and the distinctions made there should not depend on or comply to what biologists think (or do not). 
***  To clarify: That suggestion has to be taken with a grain of salt.  I see value in distinguishing '''disposition''', '''role''' and '''function'''. I'm proposing different relations between '''independent_continuant''' and '''realizable_entity''' to represent this distinction in the ontology.  I believe I understand what is ''intended'' by the current representation of that distinction, but I think the current implementation in the BFO.owl file (sticking each into a separate, disjoint class) is too harsh and will cause problems. ('''MS''' - ''July 17, 2007 9:31:47 AM EDT'')
** If there really are three different underlying notions, rejecting the three terms as ambiguous is not going to help us capture the necessary detail in our use of BFO.  
** The solution I'd like to see is not to kill the patient, but to cure him. My problem here was the distinction is not made sufficiently clear, the definitions are (somewhat typically) incomprehensible and the examples unconvincing. BFO needs to state much more clearly it's  understanding and intended use of these three distinct classes.
** The following common-sense are from onelook.com:
*** Role ''definition'':
***# normal or customary activity of a person in a particular social setting
***# what something is used for
***# the actions and activities assigned to or required or expected of a person or group
*** Function ''definition'':
***# the actions and activities assigned to or required or expected of a person or group
***# what something is used for
***# a relation such that one thing is dependent on another
*** Disposition ''definition'':
***# a natural or acquired habit or characteristic tendency in a person or thing
***# a person's inherent qualities of character
***# an inclination or tendency
***# the tendency of something to act in a certain manner under given circumstances
*** These are accessible, natural language statements, and they contain distinctions - e.g., disposition and function.  Unfortunately, there are different characteristics given which are not necessarily unique to any one of those entities.  Though accesssible, here, too, there is a need to create a more specified list of the similarities (generic '''realizable_entity''' properties) and distinctions (the distinguishing '''differentia''').
** I see another problem with BFO's realizables in the biomedical domain. Since the definition of '''bfo:function''' implies membership entails a '''realizable_entity'' must be ''essentially end-directed'' and the entity in which it inheres is ''made for'' that '''bfo:function''', need we subscribe to a specific teleological view - e.g., the ''Intelligent Design'' view of molecular functions, for example?  What are proteins and other molecules ''made for''?  Are cancer cells ''made for'' some purpose?  Why, why not?  On the other hand, is an artificial heart '''''NOT''''' ''made for'' pumping blood?

===Human/Social dependence distinshes bfo:role from bfo:disposition/bfo:function===
* '''AR''' - ''July 17, 2007 11:06:50 PM EDT''
** bfolk seem to intend '''function''' be distinct from '''role''' based on whether the '''process''' is dependent on social convention or if the '''process''' wouldn't happen if there weren't people around. So '''doctor''' is a '''role''', because recognition of the potential is dependent on there being some social convention. Similarly '''doorstop''' wouldn't make sense if there weren't doors and there wouldn't be doors if there weren't houses, and there wouldn't be houses if there weren't people. So that must be a '''role'''. By this distinction some things have both '''function''' and '''role'''. For example, a '''drug''' would have a '''therapeutic_role''', but also a '''molecular_function'''.
** I'm not exactly sure I get this correctly, but maybe one of the bfolk can clarify/correct.
** The intuitive distinction between '''disposition''' and '''function''' is one between passive and active participation, or accidental versus purposeful participation. But although I tend to naturally use the words in this way, basically I don't believe in the distinction. One might argue there is something behind this intuition - on the other hand when I used to speak french I used to have a similar tendency to attach male/female to nouns, and I don't believe that has any underlying real basis either.

*** '''AR''' - ''March 1, 2007''
**** Is there a paper with more formal defining axioms for the subtypes of '''realizable_entity''' more so than the cornucopia paper? I'm still trying to clarify the distinctions between '''role''', '''disposition''', '''function''', power, etc. 
**** '''PG''' - ''March 1, 2007 06:31 AM EDT''
***** There is nothing to my knowledge. It is possible however that some elements have been given in work on '''function'''s, maybe papers authored or co-authored by Ingvar Johansson. I will ask him. Maybe Barry will have better suggestions. 
****** '''BS''' - ''March 3, 2007 03:31 PM EDT''
******* There is nothing, as yet, except for Ingvar's and Ludger's work on tendencies:
*******# [http://home.arcor.de/metaphysicus/Texte/tendencies%20WSPI2006%20proc.pdf The Ontology of Tendencies and Medical Information Sciences]
*******# [http://hem.passagen.se/ijohansson/ontology2.htm INTENTIONALITY AND TENDENCY: HOW TO MAKE ARISTOTLE UP-TO-DATE]
******* We have been holding back until other matters solidify, but if you have proposals I would be eager to hear them.
******* First ideas:
*******# '''function'''
*******#* ''definition'': '''disposition''' that is beneficial to the bearer
*******# '''role'''
*******#* ''definition'': socially assigned '''function''' (or more likely: constellation of '''function'''s)
*******# '''power'''
*******#*  ''definition'': '''disposition''' whose realization gives rise to the release of energy
*******# '''liability'''
*******#*  ''definition'': '''disposition''' whose realization involves the absorption of energy
*******# '''tendency'''
*******#*  ''definition'': ?
*******# '''propensity'''
*******#*  ''definition'': '''disposition''' with a statistically determinate likelihood of being realized
******* BFO probably should not include all of these
******* Counterexamples welcome.

********* Re: '''function'''
********** I have a '''disposition''' to eat. Eating is ''beneficial'' for me. My '''function''' is to eat. Seems counter-intuitive to me. The problem is that ''beneficial'' depends on values of some observer, something you probably do not want. The basic idea of the realist accounts on saying what ''beneficial'' means is: 
*********** ''A'' can cause ''X''. ''A'' is there now because it caused ''X'' in the past.
********** I believe you would like to reduce '''function''' to purely realistic terms without human ascription. The best work I know of that tries to do this is Ruth Millikans [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0029-4624(198709)21%3A3%3C430%3ALTAOBC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z '''''Language, Thought and other biological categories''''']. 
********** See Searle for a number of additional counter-examples.
********* Re: '''role'''
********** I can put my stein of beer on a rock that is formed like a table. This rock has no socially assigned '''function'''. However, the rock plays the '''role''' of a table.
********** There are a number of different types of '''role'''s. You appear to be referring to social '''role'''s only. Social '''role'''s are something like '''student''' or '''employee'''. In processes, some entity may play the '''role''' of a '''transporter''', even if no society exists. In 2 < 4, ''2'' may play the '''role''' of the smaller argument. 
********** See Frank Loebe's [http://www.onto-med.de/en/publications/refereed-papers-in-proceedings/loebe-f-2005-93-a.pdf Abstract vs. Social Roles – A Refined Top-Level Ontological Analysis]
**** '''PG''' - ''March 1, 2007 06:31 AM EDT''
***** To my knowledge, we have no worked on any of the specificities of each sort of '''realizable_entity''' - I.e. we have not worked on the specificity of each sort of realization ('''process'''es and '''relation'''s). 
*** '''AR''' - ''March 1, 2007''
**** What make sense to me:
***** "Realization involves in every case three entities:
*****# a '''substance'''
*****# a '''SNAP:dependent_entity'''
*****# a ''correlated'' '''process''' 
***** (2) then ''inheres_in'' (1) in virtue of the fact (1) participates in (3)"  (however ''correlated'' is a bit fuzzy)
****** '''BS''' - ''March 3, 2007 03:31 PM EDT''
******* A '''disposition''' would then involve a correlated '''process''' (3) universal.  The realization of the '''disposition''' would be an instance.
