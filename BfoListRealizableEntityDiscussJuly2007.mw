=BFO:Realizable Entity: Distinction between Disposition, Function, and Role=

This discussion thread took place on the BFO mailing list in July 2007.  It is summarized here, since it might provide us with a clearer sense of how to proceed with OBI:Function, which must build off one or more of these BFO realizable entity types.

===Problems Distinguishing bfo:disposition, bfo:function, and bfo:role===
* '''MS''' - ''July 16, 2007 4:13:16 AM EDT''
** The distinction between realizable entities - disposition, role and function - is unclear and causing problems for me and for others trying to use it.  I now think that distinguishing disposition, role and function as separate, disjoint classes does more harm than good and might turn out to be a significant hindrance to interoperability between ontologies.
** I see '''role''' and '''function''' as subclasses of '''disposition''' -- they are types of '''disposition''' with some extra properties and constraints.
** Proposal:
*** I see '''function''' as a subclass of '''role''' -- i.e. a '''function''' is a '''role''' an entity must play throughout the extent of its existence.
*** Use Case - convert the [http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php}PDSP Ki database] to BFO / OWL
*** contains entries about receptor - ligand interactions. A typical entry consists of a receptor molecule, a ligand (binding) molecule and a Ki value (a measure for the affinity of the ligand for the receptor molecule)
*** Question: Is ligand binding:
**** disposition-to-bind
**** function-of-binding
**** role-of-binding
*** decided to just use '''bfo:realizable_entity''', as which you pick seems context-dependent and poorly specified.
** Question: Is it correct to assume '''bfo:realizable_entity''' is a type designed to make statements about ''hypothetical processes'' without mentioning such ''hypothetical'' entities because they conflict with the realist world view of BFO?
*** If so, I see no reason to distinguish the entity ''function of heart to pump blood'' ('''bfo:function''' example) from ''role of artificial heart to pump blood'' ('''bfo:role''' example) when they are realized as similar processes.
*** I would rather create a more generic type of ''realizable_entity'' (let us call it '''potential_to_pump_blood''' here) and clarify the way it is realized through the relation linking the spectific type of '''bfo:independent_continuant''' to '''potential_to_pump_blood'''. These immediate bfo subclasses of '''bfo:realizable_entity''' should not be used and should ideally be removed from BFO.
**** Example: 
***** '''biological_heart''' would link to an instance of '''potential_to_pump_blood''' through the relation "has_function"
***** '''artificial_heart''' would link to an instance of '''potential_to_pump_blood''' through the relation "has_role"
***** avoids creating highly redundant, disjoint classes like '''function_to_pump_blood''' and '''role_to_pump_blood''', with the many associated risks of creating incompatible ontologies.
