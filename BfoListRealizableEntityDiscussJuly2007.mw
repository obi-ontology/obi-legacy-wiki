=BFO:Realizable Entity: Distinction between Disposition, Function, and Role=

This discussion thread took place on the BFO mailing list in July 2007.  It is summarized here, since it might provide us with a clearer sense of how to proceed with OBI:Function, which must build off one or more of these BFO realizable entity types.  The discussion was heavily edited to hopefully promote clarity - and referencing URLs have been added to help point others to critical background material.
<br>
The thread needed to be broken into sub-threads, because it extended beyond the 32kb MediaWiki recommended page limit.
