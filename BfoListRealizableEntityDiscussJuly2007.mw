=BFO:Realizable Entity: Distinction between Disposition, Function, and Role=

This discussion thread took place on the BFO mailing list in July 2007.  It is summarized here, since it might provide us with a clearer sense of how to procede with OBI:Function, which must build off one or more of these BFO realizable entity types.

===Problems Distinguishing bfo:disposition, bfo:function, and bfo:role===
* '''MS''' - ''July 16, 2007 4:13:16 AM EDT''
** The distinction between realizable entities - disposition, role and function - is unclear and causing problems for me and for others trying to use it.
** Use Case - convert the [http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php}PDSP Ki database] to BFO / OWL
*** contains entries about receptor - ligand interactions. A typical entry consists of a receptor molecule, a ligand (binding) molecule and a Ki value (a measure for the affinity of the ligand for the receptor molecule)
*** Question: Is ligand binding:
**** disposition-to-bind
**** function-of-binding
**** role-of-binding
*** decided to just use '''bfo:realizable_entity''', as which you pick seems context-dependent and poorly specified.
