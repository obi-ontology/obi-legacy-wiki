=BFO:Realizable Entity: Distinction between Disposition, Function, and Role=

This discussion thread took place on the BFO mailing list in July 2007.  It is summarized here, since it might provide us with a clearer sense of how to proceed with OBI:Function, which must build off one or more of these BFO realizable entity types.

===Alternative bfo:realizable_entity relations to better distinguish bfo:disposition, bfo:function, and bfo:role===
* '''MS''' - ''July 16, 2007 4:13:16 AM EDT''
** The distinction between realizable entities - '''disposition''', '''role''' and '''function''' - is unclear and causing problems for me and for others trying to use it.  
*** At least, you, Alan, and I have raised the problem ('''WK''' - ''July 16, 2007 7:01:13 AM EDT'')
** I now think distinguishing '''disposition''', '''role''' and '''function''' as separate, disjoint classes does more harm than good and might turn out to be a significant hindrance to interoperability between ontologies.
*** If used improperly, e.g., because of unclear definitions and examples, yes.  If used properly, why? ('''WK''' - ''July 16, 2007 7:01:13 AM EDT'')
** Proposal:
*** I see '''role''' and '''function''' as subclasses of '''disposition''' -- they are types of '''disposition''' with some extra properties and constraints.
*** I see '''function''' as a subclass of '''role''' -- i.e. a '''function''' is a '''role''' an entity must play throughout the extent of its existence.
**** Just shuffling graph nodes won't help unless we provide a means to ''use'' the new classification you propose.  I do not necessarily object to your solution, but it is vaguely stated.  Can you provide three definitions + examples of the following:
****# '''disposition''' as subsumed by '''realizable_entity'''
****# '''role''' as subsumed by '''disposition'''
****# '''function''' as subsumed by '''role'''?
*** Use Case - convert the [http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php}PDSP Ki database] to BFO / OWL
*** contains entries about receptor - ligand interactions. A typical entry consists of a receptor molecule, a ligand (binding) molecule and a Ki value (a measure for the affinity of the ligand for the receptor molecule)
*** Question: Is ligand binding:
**** disposition-to-bind
**** function-of-binding
**** role-of-binding
*** decided to just use '''bfo:realizable_entity''', as which you pick seems context-dependent and poorly specified.
** Question: Is it correct to assume '''bfo:realizable_entity''' is a type designed to make statements about ''hypothetical processes'' without mentioning such ''hypothetical'' entities because they conflict with the realist world view of BFO?
*** If so, I see no reason to distinguish the entity ''function of heart to pump blood'' ('''bfo:function''' example) from ''role of artificial heart to pump blood'' ('''bfo:role''' example) when they are realized as similar processes.
*** I would rather create a more generic type of ''realizable_entity'' (let us call it '''potential_to_pump_blood''' here) and clarify the way it is realized through the relation linking the spectific type of '''bfo:independent_continuant''' to '''potential_to_pump_blood'''.
**** Example: 
***** '''biological_heart''' would link to an instance of '''potential_to_pump_blood''' through the relation ''has_function''
***** '''artificial_heart''' would link to an instance of '''potential_to_pump_blood''' through the relation ''has_role''
***** avoids creating highly redundant, disjoint classes like '''function_to_pump_blood''' and '''role_to_pump_blood''', with the many associated risks of creating incompatible ontologies.
****** If you object to distinguishing '''disposition''', '''role''' and '''function''' (as you do above), what sense would it make to conflate them into '''potentials''' and then use the (supposedly equally ambiguous) relations ''has_role'', ''has_function'' etc. ('''WK''' - ''July 16, 2007 7:01:13 AM EDT'')
** Proposal: These immediate bfo subclasses of '''bfo:realizable_entity''' should not be used and should ideally be removed from BFO.

===Improve defintions and examples to better distinguish bfo:disposition, bfo:function, and bfo:role===
* '''WK''' - ''July 16, 2007 7:01:13 AM EDT''
** Your suggestion to remove the distinction from BFO may be a bit overhasty;  remember BFO is a top-level ontology, and the distinctions made there should not depend on or comply to what biologists think (or do not). 
** If there really are three different underlying notions, rejecting the three terms as ambiguous is not going to help us capture the necessary detail in our use of BFO.  
** The solution I'd like to see is not to kill the patient, but to cure him. My problem here was the distinction is not made sufficiently clear, the definitions are (somewhat typically) incomprehensible and the examples unconvincing. BFO needs to state much more clearly it's  understanding and intended use of these three distinct classes.
** The following common-sense are from onelook.com:
*** Role ''definition'':
***# normal or customary activity of a person in a particular social setting
***# what something is used for
***# the actions and activities assigned to or required or expected of a person or group
*** Function ''definition'':
***# the actions and activities assigned to or required or expected of a person or group
***# what something is used for
***# a relation such that one thing is dependent on another
*** Disposition ''definition'':
***# a natural or acquired habit or characteristic tendency in a person or thing
***# a person's inherent qualities of character
***# an inclination or tendency
***# the tendency of something to act in a certain manner under given circumstances
*** These are accessible, natural language statements, and they contain distinctions - e.g., disposition and function.  Unfortunately, there are different characteristics given which are not necessarily unique to any one of those entities.  Though accesssible, here, too, there is a need to create a more specified list of the similarities (generic '''realizable_entity''' properties) and distinctions (the distinguishing '''differentia''').
** I see another problem with BFO's realizables in the biomedical domain. Since the definition of '''bfo:function''' implies membership entails a '''realizable_entity'' must be ''essentially end-directed'' and the entity in which it inheres is ''made for'' that '''bfo:function''', need we subscribe to a specific teleological view - e.g., the ''Intelligent Design'' view of molecular functions, for example?  What are proteins and other molecules ''made for''?  Are cancer cells ''made for'' some purpose?  Why, why not?  On the other hand, is an artificial heart '''''NOT''''' ''made for'' pumping blood?
