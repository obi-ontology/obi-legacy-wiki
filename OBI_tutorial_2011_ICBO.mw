==Protégé 4.1 Installation==

* Download Protégé 4.1 Release Candidate 5 at:
  http://protege.stanford.edu/download/protege/4.1/installanywhere/Web_Installers/

* Following the instruction to install Protégé which posted in the same page of download at:
  http://protege.stanford.edu/download/protege/4.1/installanywhere/Web_Installers/

* Setting Protege perferences

  Click 'File' menu and choose 'Preferences...':
# In the 'Renderer' tab, click on the 'Annotations ...' button, add 'en, en-US, !' in the languages column. 
# OBI users may need to change reasoner default settings to improve reasoning performance. In the reasoner tab "initialization" , choose only "class members" and under "Displayed inferences" choose only "unsatisfiable classes", "equivalent classes" and "superclasses".  No instance reasoning is done, but for most OBI development this isn't necessary. These settings can make a particularly big difference when using Hermit as the reasoner. 
# In the 'Save' tab, make sure XML Writer 'Use XML Entities' is checked off.
# To display the class labels rather than the OBI ids, choose 'Render entities using annotation values' in the 'Renderer' tab. If the OBI classes are still displaying as IDs, go the the 'Renderer tab', click on the 'Annotations ...' button, select 'label', leave the language column blank and hit ok. 
# Hit 'OK' button when you finish the setting
