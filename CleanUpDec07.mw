====Issues/Ideas====
 
(please add your initials to keep track of who suggested what)

MC,6/12/07
*OBI_IDs: should be 6 digits. This should probably be added to the Naming conventions page? 
*polystyrene_tube (alt_term scintilliation_tube) should probably be tube with additional properties?
*filtration_labware: should probably be labware with a role of filtration?
*labware: hard to make the difference between labware/instrument. I didn't find a definition for labware, apart from "The term “labware” refers to tube racks, plate holders and other. equipment..". In my mind labware is the "small stuff" (not a definition!) and instrument the "big stuff", but the current definiton of instrument would also apply to labware:"An instrument is a device which provides a mechanical or electronic advantage as a participant in a process".
In addition, heated_bath is under labware currently, why would it be there whereas centrifuge for example is under instrument.
*A10-Analyzer: I kept the hyphen as it is the instrument's name.
*FACSCalibur is an analyser and sorter. Should be moved under flow_cytometer_sorter?
*Guava cytometers use aspiration and not a fluid to transport the cells within the machine, however our definition of flow_cytometer says "A flow_cytometer is an instrument for counting, examining and sorting microscopic particles suspended in a stream of fluid"
