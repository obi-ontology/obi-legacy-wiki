*power_pack
*fluorometer
*liquid_chromatography_instrument

====Issues/Ideas====
 
(please add your initials to keep track of who suggested what)

MC,6/12/07

* OBI_IDs: should be 6 digits. This should probably be added to the Naming conventions page? We also should probably keep in mind to check that at some point.
*polystyrene_tube (alt_term scintilliation_tube) should probably be tube with additional properties?
*filtration_labware: should probably be labware with a role of filtration?
*paper_filter -> shall we keep it?
*supernatant_collection_system_harvesting_frame -> I don't know what that is
*labware: hard to make the difference between labware/instrument. I didn't find a definition for labware, apart from "The term “labware” refers to tube racks, plate holders and other. equipment..". In my mind labware is the "small stuff" (not a definition!) and instrument the "big stuff", but the current definiton of instrument would also apply to labware:"An instrument is a device which provides a mechanical or electronic advantage as a participant in a process".
In addition, heated_bath is under labware currently, why would it be there whereas centrifuge for example is under instrument.

FG (7/12/07) comment: As described in the annotation properties of Labware it is only a placeholder at the minute for things that are not instruments. The whole object hierarchy is under review at the moment so the separation is temporary, indicated by the annotation property "graph_position_temporary". For the short term please ignore everything under labware and just deal with instruments. I agree the definition is not great but is dependent on a re-working of the object hierarchy. 

MC (7/12/07): ok with that. I would suggest finishing the terms clean-up and our next action item could then be finalizing the hierarchy (labware, cardinal_part_of_ and _temporary)

*A10-Analyzer: I kept the hyphen as it is the instrument's name.
*FACSCalibur is an analyser and sorter. Should be moved under flow_cytometer_sorter?
*Guava cytometers use aspiration and not a fluid to transport the cells within the machine, however our definition of flow_cytometer says "A flow_cytometer is an instrument for counting, examining and sorting microscopic particles suspended in a stream of fluid"

MC,7/12/07
*computer: current def says "is an electronic instrument". should "electronic" be submitted somewhere else?
*hybridization_chamber and station: hybridization should be a role?
*thermal_cycler: alternative terms PCR_machine. As per Daniel reccomendation I put PCR and Polymerase CHain Reaction _machine as alt terms. However an other alt term is DNA_amplifier, do we want to "explode" DNA?
*ImageStream: is an image_cytometer
*Lactoscope is a  spectrophotometer
*difference between somacount and somascope?
