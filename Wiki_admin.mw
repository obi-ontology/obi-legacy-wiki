== How to edit/create pages ==

When editing/creating pages, keep the following in mind:
* When creating a pages, use capitals for the first word, lowercase for the second and subsequent words (e.g. 'Conference_call_developers' and not 'Conference_Call_Developers')
* When creating a page, it's preferred to start of with 'general' and end with more specific words (e.g. 'Conference_call_developers and not 'developers_conference_call)
* When creating a page, add the category it belongs to. You can add multiple categories for each page. Check [[Special:Categories | this page]] to see which categories we use on this wiki
* When editing/creating a page, it is always useful to add some comments in the 'Summary' field or checking the minor edit

== Create Diagrams ==

This wiki is able to create diagrams without the need of uploading any file. Using a simple syntax, one can create complex diagrams. The advantage is that others can edit the diagram on the wiki and there is no longer a need to download the original file (of the diagram). These diagrams use the language 'dot' for the creation of the files. Some examples are shown [[Graphviz_example | here]].

Some disadvantages:
* dot does not (yet) allow for Venn diagrams (cf. overlapping clusters)
* Large diagrams tend to become (too) big. This can be resolved by decreasing the font size or by applying ranks to the various elements


== Style & Design ==

A quick overview of some of the CSS.

* MediaWiki:Sidebar is styled using regular skin specific css. CSS added to 'main.css' (obi-ontology/w/skins/cc4).

== How to Create Tables ==

To allow for a consistent styling of tables, we created a class in the main.css file. This class defines the headers, the width and length of the tables. It is recommended to use this class, and overrule some of its style if needed. 
(in progress)

= ToDo list =

Too much to list here, but some of it includes:
* create style for tables
* move imported pages

= Progress (temp for moving old wiki) =
== So far... ==
I've
* Changed the color of the sidebar as all the links on the wiki to a more soft color.
* Sidebar
** Reduced the font of the menu: there is no easy way (to my knowledge) to create a two column sidebar. I thought (hoped) it would work using tables, yet no luck. I can always try to add div's to it to tweak it a little. Any comments more then welcome. 
** Added some links, some pages need to be created.

== Added pages ==
* Some admin pages (can be seen on categorytree)

== Questions ==
* Do we need google analytics (extension) for the wiki, to keep track of the most popular pages so we know which pages 'must' be maintained?
