== So far... ==
I've
* Changed the color of the sidebar as all the links on the wiki to a more soft color.
* Sidebar
** Reduced the font of the menu: there is no easy way (to my knowledge) to create a two column sidebar. I thought (hoped) it would work using tables, yet no luck. I can always try to add div's to it to tweak it a little. Any comments more then welcome. 
** Added some links, some pages need to be created.

== Added pages ==
* Some admin pages (can be seen on categorytree)

== Questions ==
* Do we need google analytics (extension) for the wiki, to keep track of the most popular pages so we know which pages 'must' be maintained?
