This page is intended for those pages related to the admin of the OBI wiki. Read through the guidelines to know how to edit/create pages.

This category lists the regular pages which aren't special pages, but nevertheless are used to manage and maintain the wiki. Do note that this list does not list the [[Special:Specialpages | special pages]].

== How to edit/create pages ==

When editing/creating pages, keep the following in mind:
* When creating a pages, '''use capitals for the first word, lowercase for the second''' and subsequent words (e.g. 'Conference_call_developers' and not 'Conference_Call_Developers')
* When creating a page, it's preferred to '''start of with 'general' and end with more specific words''' (e.g. 'Conference_call_developers and not 'developers_conference_call)
* When creating a page, '''add the category it belongs to'''. You can add multiple categories for each page. Check [[Special:Categories | this page]] to see which categories we use on this wiki
* When editing/creating a page, it is always useful to add '''some comments in the 'Summary' field''' or checking the minor edit
* When creating a page, ask yourself ''''Do we really need another page for this''''?
* When creating pages related to a '''specific event, add the datum''' at the end of page title (e.g. Workshop_notes_2008_july_9 or Woekshop_notes_2008_july_9-12 and not 2008_Workshop_notes nor Notes_workshop_2008_winter).

== Create Diagrams ==

This wiki is able to create diagrams without the need of uploading any file. Using a simple syntax, one can create complex diagrams. The advantage is that others can edit the diagram on the wiki and there is no longer a need to download the original file (of the diagram). These diagrams use the language 'dot' for the creation of the files. Some examples are shown [[Graphviz_example | here]].

Some disadvantages:
* dot does not (yet) allow for Venn diagrams (cf. overlapping clusters)
* Large diagrams tend to become (too) big. This can be resolved by decreasing the font size or by applying ranks to the various elements


== How to Create Tables ==

To allow for a consistent styling of tables, we created a class in the main.css file. This class defines the headers, the width and length of the tables. It is recommended to use this class, and overrule some of its style if needed. 
(in progress).

For a more detailed overview on how to use tables, see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Table this wikipedia page]].


= ToDo list =

Too much to list here, but some of it includes:
* create style for tables
* move imported pages


== Style & Design ==

Some important notes on the CSS of the wiki (for those who are interested):

* MediaWiki:Sidebar is styled using regular skin specific css. CSS added to 'main.css' (obi-ontology/w/skins/cc4).
* Currently categories are hidden using css (display:none in obi-ontology/w/skins/cc4/main.css)
* Tables are styled using table specific class (obi-ontology/w/skins/cc4/main.css)


= Progress (temp for moving old wiki) =

I'll go through all the pages and categorize them. Some pages can be dropped and joined. After this first round, I will go through all the dropped, joined and ? pages and finalize the import. 
After the import I will correct the links. 


== So far... ==
I've
* Changed the color of the sidebar as all the links on the wiki to a more soft color.
* Added a few categories [[Category_Tree | see Category Tree]]
* Sidebar
** Reduced the font of the menu: there is no easy way (to my knowledge) to create a two column sidebar. I thought (hoped) it would work using tables, yet no luck. I can always try to add div's to it to tweak it a little. Any comments more then welcome. 
** Added some links, some pages need to be created.
* Imported [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Category:Moved these pages]. I renamed quite a few pages using the guidelines I formulated for the wiki.

== Moved/Imported pages ==
An overview (on the old wiki) to see which pages have been imported, check [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Category:Moved this page]. To see which pages are not yet imported check [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Special:Uncategorizedpages this page].

* Some admin pages (can be seen on [[Category_Tree | categorytree]])

== Drop & Join pages + Action pages ==
[https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Category:Dropped These pages] are currently considered not useful and as such dropped. <br>
Is it a good idea to join [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Category:Join these pages]. Joining means loosing the history and discussions. (working on it)<br>
What's shall we do with all the [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Category:Action_items action pages] on the old wiki? Submit to tracker, drop or create 1 page? Currently the following pages and content will be added to the [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Category:Tracker Tracker]<br>
Where do [https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/Category:%3F these pages] belong to?

Overall: a lot of pages are discussion pages or reports dating back to 2007. Is it useful to still import them and how should we do that? Join them, import them into category 'archive'...?
