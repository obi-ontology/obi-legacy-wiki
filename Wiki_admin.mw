== How to edit/create pages ==

When editing/creating pages, keep the following in mind:
* When creating a pages, '''use capitals for the first word, lowercase for the second''' and subsequent words (e.g. 'Conference_call_developers' and not 'Conference_Call_Developers')
* When creating a page, it's preferred to '''start of with 'general' and end with more specific words''' (e.g. 'Conference_call_developers and not 'developers_conference_call)
* When creating a page, '''add the category it belongs to'''. You can add multiple categories for each page. Check [[Special:Categories | this page]] to see which categories we use on this wiki
* When editing/creating a page, it is always useful to add '''some comments in the 'Summary' field''' or checking the minor edit
* When creating a page, ask yourself ''''Do we really need another page for this''''?
* When creating pages related to a '''specific event, add the datum''' at the end of page title (e.g. Workshop_notes_2008_july_9 or Woekshop_notes_2008_july_9-12 and not 2008_Workshop_notes nor Notes_workshop_2008_winter).

== Create Diagrams ==

This wiki is able to create diagrams without the need of uploading any file. Using a simple syntax, one can create complex diagrams. The advantage is that others can edit the diagram on the wiki and there is no longer a need to download the original file (of the diagram). These diagrams use the language 'dot' for the creation of the files. Some examples are shown [[Graphviz_example | here]].

Some disadvantages:
* dot does not (yet) allow for Venn diagrams (cf. overlapping clusters)
* Large diagrams tend to become (too) big. This can be resolved by decreasing the font size or by applying ranks to the various elements


== How to Create Tables ==

To allow for a consistent styling of tables, we created a class in the main.css file. This class defines the headers, the width and length of the tables. It is recommended to use this class, and overrule some of its style if needed. 
(in progress).

For a more detailed overview on how to use tables, see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Table this wikipedia page]].
