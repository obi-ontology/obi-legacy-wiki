===2009 Clean-up Meeting, Philadelphia===

'''Minutes'''

=Working through the paper=

AI: HP to retrofit the fix the ppt to the current manuscript master - done, sf item
closed

AI: check for inconsistencies in 3 or 5 years 

AI: instrument vs. device 

issues with device, catch all for many things. before device had to have function

BP: want defined classes for the obvious ones.

AI: remove device, instrument and platform create subclasses of processed material
e.g. ,measurement device, mat entity created with produce data function. need many
that will take all the stuff we have. 

Issues with platform - we have microarray platform. 

AI: action item for the discussion


==IAO issues==

1. textual entity vs, in head - we decide that conclusion is a textual entity - 

AI: we will add conclusion as a child of textual entity in IAO space

AI: we ask for deprecate study interpretation from IAO.

2. conclusion is hypothesis proving, or is also interpretation of the hypothesis

3. label study interpretation or conclusion



investigation=planning->study design execution->documenting->study results
optional - data interpretation



==Roles and functions==
