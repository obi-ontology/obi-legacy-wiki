===Agenda items===

Please add proposed agenda items below. If you have any specific time constraint please use the dated slots below and add why the constraint.

* What happens next? The longer term plan for continuing OBI development.
* OBI classes into IAO and BFO
* Neurocommons hacking session
* Namespace discussion (if not solved earlier): We need a policy that can be applied not just to MSI but for any other ontology that will be later 'included' in OBI (e.g. SepCV).
* Refine and agree on obi policy regarding prohibited assertions under defined classes: https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/DefinedClasses
* Making the old wiki read-only and moving over to the [http://obi-ontology.org new wiki]
* quickterm proposal
* 10 terms per branch
* Larisa: automated investigations
* conferred qualities
* variables
* define a standard procedure for communities to submit new terms to OBI (I believe this is related to the QuickTerms sub-project)
** What should the community do to facilitate the process?
** How will OBI incorporate? Who will be responsible?
** Do we need different processes for asserted vs defined classes?
