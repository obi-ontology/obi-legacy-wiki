* What happens next? The longer term plan for continuing OBI development.
* OBI classes into IAO and BFO
* Making the old wiki read-only and moving over to the [http://obi-ontology.org new wiki]
* define a standard procedure for communities to submit new terms to OBI (I believe this is related to the QuickTerms and QuickID sub-project)
