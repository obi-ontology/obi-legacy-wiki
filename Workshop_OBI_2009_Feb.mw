==The Winter 2009 workshop will be February 2-6, 2009==
===Proposed location is Vancouver, Canada (by slight majority)===

There was a slight preference for Vancouver (8 votes) over Boston (7 votes). While there was a lot of overlap in votes, there was some discordance. At the coordinator call on September 10 it was decided that it was important to determine if the discordance was due to just preference or a real difficulty in coming to Vancouver. If you will be unable to attend Vancouver due to location please post a note below by September 17.
