== List of terms submitted to the Biomaterial branch ==
=== Second round (Sept 07), terms from: ===
====Protocol Application Branch====
[https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/images/2/29/Protocol_App_to_Biomaterialt2.txt Redirected Terms, which were bounced from the protocol application branch].


=== First round (April 07), terms from: ===

====MO====
[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~parkinso/biomaterialterms_mo_plus_bacterial_obi_format.xls MO Transcriptomic Terms plus immuno plus Tox terms]
* merged the other lists and reformatted for the conf call
contains current MO ~BioMaterial '''and now terms for sequences on arrays''' terms with definitions and mappings to PATO.
Thanks to PATO (Chris M., Michael A, and George G) for the comments on the MO-PATO mappings. Terms have been added from BUG@S Bacterial array database (thanks to Adam Witney) and ~ArrayExpress. Excel file Extra columns are present in the xls file are: PATO id, PATO term, comment.

====Immune Epitope====
[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/Submissionterms-Biomaterial.txt Immuno BioMaterial terms]

====Env====

====Cellular Assay Community (MIACA)====
[http://www.smp-cell.org/Files/MIACA_Biomaterials.xls terms as Excel list]<br>
[http://www.smp-cell.org/Files/MIACA_Biomaterials.doc and as word file], terms not related to biomaterials in grey. We are not totally sure where Materials start to be not <Bio> any more.<br><br>

[http://www.smp-cell.org/Files/Media''Perturbators.xls Examples of Media and supplements, and of perturbator''types] This is in response to the conference call on Mar 23<br>

Communities are compiling lists of their ~BioMaterial term requirements (preferably following the naming conventions<sup>[[http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MGEDontology.php 2| NamingConventions]]</sup>) as a tab-delimited file  (term name and definition) - all needed terms if time permits. As for granularity, examples will be provided of the terms as they would be used in annotations.  The term's parent class should also be specified according to an existing ontology, preferably one amongst the [http://obofoundry.org/ OBO Foundry ] constellation of ontologies. For example, for transcriptomics an example using terms as they exist in the [http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MGEDontology.php MGED Ontology (MO)] would be ~MaterialType as the parent class and the annotation terms of genomic''DNA, cell, cell''lysate etc.

Lists of required relationships are also being compiled. For example, partipants are compiling relations required to create a formal specification of an action/treatment/protocol performed on a given ~BioMaterial. Where possible, candidate relations should be taken from - or at least derived from - the [http://obo.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?relationship OBO Relations (RO)] ontology.
