==== -> Please, add here below any topic/issue you would like to bring up and discuss at the upcoming workshop. E.g.:
====

* Incorporate term needs of communities into the [[FuGO]] OWL file

* Info currently disperse in emails
Shall we centralize the info on wiki?
Make a list of resources, e.g. for time, units (URLs, status and usage). Summarize the technical solutions , for example, on how to import external resources, problems with lang attribute etc.

* Address OE Metadata capture
Identify which metadata (e.g. synonyms, preferred names, versions, provenance)should be captured and the mechanism to capture these.
Suggestion: Evaluate Dublin Core, Protege (Meta-)Annotation properties and self-created Annotation properties. Look at the NCI Thesaurus that has mechanisms for doing so. But we should be careful not to use any semantics which forces us into OWL-Full.

* Multiple or single parenthood
Why is the multiple inheritance a problem? Pros and cons.

* How to use relations to connect the terms in the taxonomy
How can we profit from the inheritance of object properties assigned to top level classes?
Again we should be careful not to go in OWL-Full.
