===Ted Liefeld Gene Pattern Presentation=== * add ppt *

In silico support for reproducible research. Info to reproduce the research.

Accessible to different levels of users.

Workflow support 

Local dist/computing

Gene pattern 60 analyses, 14 reformatters dataloaders, 18 visualizers, 8 pipelines

Using O-XML - uses LSIDs. Taverna use scuffle. Limitation - param files external in a provenance recording system in RDF. 

When module defined has some semantic support in Genepattern

Execution logs come with the output files.

Discussion on the formats which are used to define inputs and outputs per module. List of formats and relationship to the processes are available.

NB. Zelig is not yet plugged into gene pattern

Using OBI in Genepattern.

Using GCT and RES - local genepattern formats. Tab delimited formats embedded in GenePattern

Extend file readers for MAGE-TAB.

Within MAGE-TAB can record a workflow. Want to do this in a generic way. OBI id for the analysis type.

Can reverse generate a pipeline from an analysis - possibly done in any tool.

Seen in OBI about the analyses - need something regarding the parameters. E.g. random seeds - for reproducibiliy need to have some reproducibility. IEEE spec for random number generators may not been enough. 

Need parameter values to map analyses from other systems.

Execution logs replaced by SDRF. 

Define generic protocols using OBI ids rather than LSIDs - static, need to be able to add these easily to the examples. 

Categorization of analysis - large menu of terms that describe analyses.

Need to map terms between tools e.g. GenePattern vs. GEWorkbench - different names, same method. Already allow suites, want to have tag clouds - people can add their own names. Want to prepopulate this from OBI.

AI:Look at the categorization in GenePattern and check vs. the current OBI objectives, should be some 

AI:GenePatterns needs parameters as well as analysis methods
