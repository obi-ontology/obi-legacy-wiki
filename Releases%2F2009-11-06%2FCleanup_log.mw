Alan, working on editor note cleanup.

=== Checking that the editor notes that just have msi ids all have appropriate definition sources ===

=== What was done to editor notes ===
* All editor notes were reviewed and categorized into several categories by Alan. Melanie reviewed and made some changes, almost all of which were accepted. The results are in the columns "disposition" (alan's) and "disposition 2" (melanies). 
** "check" - a tracker item will be entered
** "ignore" - is ignored already
** "definition editor" - misplaced definition editor
** "todo" - a tracker item will be entered
** "obsolete" - an obsolete term
** "asked philippe"  - editor notes "MO" or "MSI" - he said to delete
** "asked jennifer" - CDISC definitions
** "separate"  - put in a separate file (not for release)
** "user" - possibly of interest to user
** "delete" - obsolete note

* Those editor notes marked "separate" "check" "todo" "asked jennifer" were changed into "curator note" annotations. If there was a mark in "disposition 2" it was preferred over whatever was in "disposition".
* Those marked "user" were left as editor notes
* All other notes were discarded.

All are currently in the single obi file. Curator notes will not be included in release.
