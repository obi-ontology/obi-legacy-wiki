[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_post_11May07_HP-SAS.xls Post 11th May 2007 call]: 

1) terms for other branches or ontology (nearly) sorted, second sheet cleaned up (edited by Helen and Susanna)

== 13 April, 2007 ==

[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_post_13April07_SAS.xls Post 13th Apr 2007 call]: 

1) terms by Ryan (flow cytometry) and Tina sorted, sheet cleaned up (edited by Susanna)

[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_ante_13April07_SAS.xls Ante 13th Apr 2007 call]: 

1) terms by Ryan (flow cytometry) added; <br>
2) sheet cleaned up (edited by Susanna)

== 23 March, 2007 ==

[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_post_23March07_SAS.xls Post 23th Mar 2007 call]: <br>
1)terms by Stefan (MIACA) sorted under ~BioMaterial and others (edited by Susanna)

[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_ante_23March07_SAS.xls Ante 23th Mar 2007 call]: <br>
1)added terms submitted by Tina (Polim) and those Stefan (MIACA)'s terms listed as ~BioMaterial (excluding those under 'project description' and 'instrument')(edited by Susanna)

== 16 March, 2007 ==

[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_post_16March07_SAS.xls Post 16th Mar 2007 call]: <br>
1) added another column with comments made during the call; <br>
2) some terms have been moved to the worksheet contaning terms for others branches or to be submitted to other ontologies  (edited by Susanna)

[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_ante_16March07_LM.xls Ante 16th Mar 2007 call]: <br>

1) discussed PSI ion terms with Trish, Puneet, Helen, Susanna and Daniel and decided to point to PSI for these (then PSI will cross ref with PATO or ChEBI) (edited by Luisa)

== 9 March, 2007 ==

[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_post_9March07_PRS_SAS.xls Post 9th Mar 2007 call] <br>
1)added a column with comments made during the call; <br> 
2) some related terms have been grouped for further discussions (duplicated terms are still there, to keep track of the needs expressed by more than one community); <br>
3) in black bold face, those areas requiring additional discussion; <br>
3) ref: 'Purity', this really sounds like a quality with an associated measurement (90% pure or contaminated with 10 % neutrphiles), keeping this here seems to be inconsistent with other properties being moved to PATO such as 'Mass' for instance <br>
2) all entries to be moved to others branches or submitted to other ontologies have been moved in a different worksheet (edited by Philippe) <br>

[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~sansone/FuGO/biobranch_ante_9March07_SAS_PRS.xls Ante 9th Mar 2007 call]: <br>
Worksheets added, terms sorted by relevance to this branch (edited by Philippe, Susanna)

initial list if terms collated, grey lines are not in biomaterial scope according to last call (edited by Helen)
