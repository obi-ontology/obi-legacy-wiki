-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Agenda: Goal is to have all of the concepts in place, resolve naming issues, road map to completing the branch also to revisit the general milestones and make sure that Data Transformation is in good shape to deal with that.

1. General introduction to OBI and DT branch JM

EM:The OWL file is not updated with the current roles, there's a google doc, and we need access to the document. Melanie has access and we need access to this tomorrow

1a. Clinical Investigation Ontology 

RS: we thought might be a branch or a parallel development, decided at last workshop is a community and getting terms together for clinical investigation and these fit in the branches. Looking to give first pass structure and then feed to branch structure, use with views. Most of RS time is devoted to this part of OBI. Lots of roles, protocols and plans, few data transformation terms. Most not unique to clinical investigations.

1b. Relations branch. 
CC. started with the relations ontology, idea is that traditionally ontologies were tree structures using is-a, when representing clinical reality need other relation types. Next paper RO2 being drafted, want to build something for OBI needs.

EM:For roles which will have has_the_role of yes?
CC:yes that's in RO one
JM:we have not coded any roles in the OWL file
EM:but we need to do this, we just need the roles
We check and OBI roles are in there. 

1c. Deriving from BFO - history of this was that it was the best fit even though it's not perfect. 
Current hierarchy

Process
 PlannedProcess
  ProtocolApplication
    DataTransformation - output=data, input=data etc

Discussion of whether synth of oligos is data->material, currently not a supported case.
EM:Recently changed data transformation definition to better relate to the siblings.

RS:there are terms where there are plans and protocol application in clinical investigations and is very sloppy. Bigger issue in the clinical arena, as there are ethical/legal issues and plans are more commonly formulated in advance. Protocol is a child of InformationEntity.

CC:this is an example with the colloquial language problems. People confuse things that are out there with info that is about the things out there. Is another examples.

RS:we discussed this at the last workshop and that's where the DENRI branch is working


2. Roles file has been circulated to dt people by Melanie who has access to the google docs
for discussion this afternoon.

3. Reviewing the OWL file for data transformation

EM:MathematicalFunction we have agreed to remove.
JM:we need to consider fundamental maths and stats and where we should stop. It's subjective, if it's basic and is well understood e.g. sine, cosine etc then we will use it anyway.
TB:Philippe wanted to add these e.g. for sine etc, and wanted a placeholder. 
RoS:we need these things, and if there is no other name space.
EM:Not just math function, could there be a primitive class such as sine, cosine that we can then point of these. All current definitions have issues. Could just add the names for now. I would'nt put under our branch and shift them out
TB:Ok but how do I organise it, if it's a MathematicalTransformation I expect to see it under data transformation.
EM:Every def involves terms, not defining all terms, sine and cosine don't need to be defined.
RiS:Add terms need to have defs, but they can be from another source.
EM:I would take these current functions as granted
DS:similar problem with the instrument branch, as where cases are a make and a type no-one needs a definition. We want something usable.
RoS:If have a list of trig functions and someone complains and get them to define it
HP:like the idea of having these terms in the branch. 
TB:what other terms might we need?
EM:P-value is a good example, is a stat term. 
RiS:Arithmetic, geometric, etc
EM:put in one place, and group
RS:BasicMathematicalFunctions?
TB:Suggest that we leave the name as is and revisit if there is a case that breaks the name
EM:at least remove the definitions
DS:OBI now tries to model everything in a granular way, not sure it it's realistic. For OBI we need a policy to get people to do the work and define as a sub ontology, and find some mathematicians. Question should OBO organisation deal with this. 
HP:we need to do the do-able while recognising that there is a problem, a math ontology is needed
EM:Math is an ontology
RiS:not formally represented in this way
EM:agree with Daniel, not realistic to do this in this community, if you really want to have pointers reference them instead of defining.
MC:we need to keep this in our branch, people will not browse by hand, search for terms and if not in dt, if in some primitive branch, would be better to point out to it as a primitive term. 
RS:They are all dt through as well as being functions and so they can live here
RS:the cosine is not the application of a cosine, and this is about application of cosine here .
EM:Suggest that we can add _transformation to the terms to make it clear that we are not defining sine but a sine transformation
RobS. What's the implication of adding these terms to dt branch. When I query will I get the wrong answer. If not then there's not a problem.
RiS: The intention is that there can be defs brought in, for these things we don't need definitions.
EM:Don't feel so strongly that keep them here
MC:if you add _transformation then you'll need to define it
EM:COuld be application of a function of type sine, where sine is defined elsewhere
TB:disliked sine_transformation
RiS: by place in hierarchy then the definition is part by context
CC:question, sine is a class, is there an example of an instance, is it an instance, or is it a class. Maybe these are instances and not have class posn. If do that with these may need to do with all math functions
RiS:Not sure there is an instance of sine, but there is an instance of application of sine
CC:sine sounds like a process
All:yes, this we're defining the process not the sine
EM:Will we have instances:
DS:we have not got a use case where we need instances
EM: use case e.g. differential_expression_analysis - need algorithm e.g. SAM, don't see these as classes see this as instances of diff_exp_analysis
RiS:SAM is a type not an instance
EM:not a class
RiS:we don't have instances in the ontology, think SAM is a class, when apply SAM with parameters then this is instantiated
DS:If look at the properties view, an instances needs all the properties to be true as well helps think of what an instance vs a class is.
RiS:looking at SAM, see that could also think that SAM is a bootstrap analysis and is a permutation test. Want to re-use the permutation analysis. Want to remove context from hierarchy
EM:SAM is not in the h'archy. Permutation analysis is a methodology
RiS:there are lots of roles for permutations analysis e.g. in differential_expression_analysis
EM:expectation maximisation, used in multi contexts. Need something besides role e.g. method used by
RoS:seems like same kind of thing as protocol and protocol application. 
RiS:need to tackle role 
EM:role will not work for everything
RoS:techniques and application of techniques
RiS:OK but application of a permutation test can't be the context, need to re-use
RM:not opposed to that
RiS:need to decide now whether this is a logical design or is about the application.
EM:Should not be children of differential expression
MM:parametric/non parametric, 
EM:we don't want an ontology for statistics
TB:but we need these terms
EM:we need how we will use them, will we subclass, or have properties, a lot of analysis methods will use different method
MC:utilizes method/technique, e.g. parametric test and children here
RiS:is there a stats branch? 
JM:we have probablistic, measurement terms were removed from this branch


 










AA:We agree to remove the definitions and leave the class as is for now as a container for similar terms and that we will not address defining the math functions. S



















<b>To do:</b>
** We need to schedule some time to check relations these with our development.
** Move agenda item on roles for Tuesday to today and review the roles, qualities before we start editing the branch
