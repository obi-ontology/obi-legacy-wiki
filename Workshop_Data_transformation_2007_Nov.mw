Agenda: Goal is to have all of the concepts in place, resolve naming issues, road map to completing the branch also to revisit the general milestones and make sure that Data Transformation is in good shape to deal with that.

1. General introduction to OBI and DT branch JM

EM:The OWL file is not updated with the current roles, there's a google doc, and we need access to the document. Melanie has access and we need access to this tomorrow

1a. Clinical Investigation Ontology 

RS: we thought might be a branch or a parallel development, decided at last workshop is a community and getting terms together for clinical investigation and these fit in the branches. Looking to give first pass structure and then feed to branch structure, use with views. Most of RS time is devoted to this part of OBI. Lots of roles, protocols and plans, few data transformation terms. Most not unique to clinical investigations.

1b. Relations branch. 
CC. started with the relations ontology, idea is that traditionally ontologies were tree structures using is-a, when representing clinical reality need other relation types. Next paper RO2 being drafted, want to build something for OBI needs.

EM:For roles which will have has_the_role of yes?
CC:yes that's in RO one
JM:we have not coded any roles in the OWL file
EM:but we need to do this, we just need the roles
We check and OBI roles are in there. 

1c. Deriving from BFO - history of this was that it was the best fit even though it's not perfect. 
Current hierarchy

 PlannedProcess
  ProtocolApplication
    DataTransformation - output=data, input=data etc

Discussion of whether synth of oligos is data->material, currently not a supported case.
EM:Recently changed data transformation definition to better relate to the siblings.

RS:there are terms where there are plans and protocol application in clinical investigations and is very sloppy. Bigger issue in the clinical arena, as there are ethical/legal issues and plans are more commonly formulated in advance. Protocol is a child of InformationEntity.

CC:this is an example with the colloquial language problems. People confuse things that are out there with info that is about the things out there. Is another examples.

RS:we discussed this at the last workshop and that's where the DENRI branch is working


2. Roles file has been circulated to dt people by Melanie who has access to the google docs









<b>To do:</b>
** We need to schedule some time to check relations these with our development.
** Move agenda item on roles for Tuesday to today and review the roles, qualities before we start editing the branch
