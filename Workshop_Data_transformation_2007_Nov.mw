-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Agenda: Goal is to have all of the concepts in place, resolve naming issues, road map to completing the branch also to revisit the general milestones and make sure that Data Transformation is in good shape to deal with that.

1. General introduction to OBI and DT branch JM

EM:The OWL file is not updated with the current roles, there's a google doc, and we need access to the document. Melanie has access and we need access to this tomorrow

1a. Clinical Investigation Ontology 

RS: we thought might be a branch or a parallel development, decided at last workshop is a community and getting terms together for clinical investigation and these fit in the branches. Looking to give first pass structure and then feed to branch structure, use with views. Most of RS time is devoted to this part of OBI. Lots of roles, protocols and plans, few data transformation terms. Most not unique to clinical investigations.

1b. Relations branch. 
CC. started with the relations ontology, idea is that traditionally ontologies were tree stuctures using is-a, when representing clinical reality need other relation types. Next paper RO2 being drafted, want to build something for OBI needs.

EM:For roles which will have has_the_role of yes?
CC:yes that's in RO one
JM:we have not coded any roles in the OWL file
EM:but we need to do this, we just need the roles
We check and OBI roles are in there. 

!!To do:!!
** We need to schedule some time to synch these with our development.
