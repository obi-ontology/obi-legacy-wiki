To add a new term into OBI, please provide minimal required metadata of the term if possible, which are
  Definition
  Definition Source
  Definition Editor
  Editor Preferred Term
  Curation status

* '''Definition''': should follow OBO foundry principle (http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/OBO_Foundry_Principles):
  the genus-species form: An A =def. a B which Cs, where B is the parent of the defined term A and C is the defining characteristic of those Bs which are also As. 
For example, the textual definition of OBI_'container' (a subclass of 'device') is:
  A device that can be used to restrict the location of material entities over time.
For a defined class, which could have more than one parent class after reasoning. The definition is not necessary to begin with its direct superclass. It can start with 'a material entity' (subclass of '_defined_material') or 'a processual_entity' (subclass of '_defined processes'). For example, the textual definition of OBI_'specimen' (a subclass of '_defined_material') is:
  A material entity that has the specimen role.

* '''Definition Editor''': to distinguish the editor is a person or a group. The 'PERSON:' or 'GROUP:' will be added and followed by person name(s) or group name(s), respectively. The 'PERSON:' or 'GROUP:' are case insensitive. For example,
  PERSON:Bjoern Peters
  Group:OBI group

If there are multiple editors, it can create Definition Editor annotation for each person/group, or using comma separate different persons/groups in one Definition Editor annotation. For example,
  Definition Editor - PERSON:Bjoern Peters,Helen Parkinson 
or
  Definition Editor - PERSON:Bjoern Peters
  Definition Editor - PERSON:Helen Parkinson
Both formats are fine.

* '''Definition Source''': could be person(s), group, website, external ontology, ISBN, PUBMED ID, DOI, etc. For example,
  PERSON:Chris Stoeckert
  GROUP:OBI group
  WEB:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray
  MO_697 arrayer

If definition is taken or modified from an external ontology term, it is recommended provide the external ontology term ID.

* '''Editor Preferred Term''': should be same as the term label
The Term Label will be copied to 'Editor Preferred Term' using the script during the OBI release. It means any value given in this annotation will be overwritten. It is recommended 
  not touch this annotation when you add/edit terms.
If you would like to add synonym, please add it to 'alternative term'. 

* '''curation status''': commonly used curation status when adding a new term:
  uncurated: nothing except label
  metadata incomplete: not all required metadata are provided or the editor still works on the provided minimal metadata. (should be more than label provided)
  metadata complete: all required metadata have been provided

It is not recommended set the curation status of a term as 'pending final vetting' and 'ready for release' if nobody other than the definition editor which is one person review the term.
	
In the OBI release version, no term should be at 'uncurated' status. The terms which curation status is 'organizational term' (renamed from 'placeholder') or 'example to be eventually removed' will be removed before the release.
