== Data Transformation Ontology Branch==
----
The Data Transformation Branch is an OBI Branch with the scope of identifying and ontologising entities and relations to describe processes which produce output data given some input data.  For example, the application of a clustering protocol to microarray data or the application of a statistical testing method on a primary data set to determine a p-value.
