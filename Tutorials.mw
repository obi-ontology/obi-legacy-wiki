==SVN==

see http://obi-ontology.org/page/General_introduction#SVN

==Checkout and set up Protege ==


* Install latest Protege 3.4.1 version from 
http://protege.stanford.edu/download/registered.html 
Use only 3.4.1, other versions are buggy or have reasoning issues

* Install an svn client. For windows, we recommend 
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ for Mac try SmartSVN http://www.syntevo.com/smartsvn/index.html

* Using the svn client, check out 
http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology 
(If you want to commit changes back to the repository, you will need to use
https: instead of http:, and will need a sourceforge password for obi. Contact the project admins to do this - Alan Ruttenberg, Melanie Courtot are admins)

* Go to the directory: ontology\branches 

* we made some changes 8 Oct 09. There is a new OBI file which gives a widget to help adding annotation properties and curation status etc. These instructions have been updated accordingly

* download obi.owl, obi-edit.owl and the .template extension files. Rename the obi-edit.pprj.template file to obi-edit.pprj, and obi-edit.repository.template -> obi.edit.repository

* open the obi-edit.pprj file in protege 3.4.1
(double clicking works on windows)

* This will give you access to the obi.owl merged file plus annotation assistance widgets. If you use the pprj and Protege 3.4.1 then the rdfs labels will display obi class names automatically. 

* You must select the obi.owl as the active ontology by clicking on the meta data tab, select obi.owl. If you don't do this edits will not propagate to the correct file obi.owl and you'll be editing obi-edit.owl.

* Pencil icon should be active, if not go to OWL tab, ontology repositories and deselect read only for the relevant file, pencil icon now should be active

* When new classes are created, they will display as URLs in the class
view until they are assigned an rdfs:label. Add the label as usual -
rdfs:label should is listed in the annotation properties.

* If you are editing OBI we are now working with a merged file rather than a series of branch files(pre mid 2009) therefore:

* You MUST edit in 3.4.1

* Do an SVN update of your local repository prior to editing to ensure your files are updated

* Send email to the devel list before checking out, after checking in

* Keep edits short, save and reason regularly.

* OBI imports several ontologies, you can find these in svn at: 

* launch the file using the obi-edit.pprj by clicking on it - you will find on editing that the obi.owl file has been updated and the obi-edit.owl, which imports this file has also been updated. You can also the obi.owl (not the obi-edit.owl) file in 3.4.1. - you won't get the widgets for annotation properties if you chose to edit this file. NOT recommended.

* As of Mar 2010 reasoning is working in 3.4.1 using Pellet 1.5.2. If reasoning is running slowly you may be importing some parts of OBI from the web. You need to point these at local files. 

==Managing OBI's Imports==

* OBI imports some external ontologies e.g. IAO and these are present in OBI svn - see \obi\trunk\src\ontology\external which you should have checked out - the files you need are .owl extensions in this directory and sub-directories

* In protege 3.4.1 (described here for windows) go to OWL tab

* choose ontology repositories

* Use the project tab and for each import point the path of the import to the local file you have checked out and force read only - you don't want to be editing imported ontologies.

* click the + (plus) symbol, choose local folder, browse for the folder you need, and then force read  only, you'll need to do this once for each import file in the svn\obi\trunk\src\ontology\external directory: 

iao.owl

bfo.owl

bfo11.owl, 

protege.owl

protege-dc.owl

ro.owl

ro_bfo_bridge11.owl

* Once all the imports are local, you should find reasoning speed improved.

==Sourceforge==

1. First, you need to have a sourceforge.net account. If you do not have one, register at sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/account/registration/ .

2. Second, email one of the OBI sourceforge administrators listed OBI sourceforge site. Alternatively,  email the obi developer mailing list (obi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). You will very likely be issued the right to access OBI sourceforge. This will allow you to make changes in OBI sourceforge.


<hr>

==Reasoning==

* Use Protege 3.4.1 and Pellet 1.5.2 as standard. 

If reasoning fails with these try 4, or try the development version java application. In general over-use of axioms and over-modelling will slow reasoning down, so decide if these are really necessary e.g there is a use case. If the pattern has been used already elsewhere then there is a good chance reasoning will be OK. It's a good idea to compare reasoning times before and after editing.


 [http://docs.google.com/View?id=dzprnmw_71chch6pfk google doc explaining a diagnotics application]

''Authors: Melanie Courtot, Alan Ruttenberg [http://groups.google.com/group/obi-developer/browse_thread/thread/94292461fca2a907?hl=en# - Alan's google group page''] and Helen Parkinson.

The aim is to detect problems with the OWL file that cause OBI to reason slowly. Some use of axioms prevents this. The application described provides some support for detecting and visualising these cases and some usage examples are included here. It's bleeding edge, contact Alan for details on usage, or see the google doc link above.

==Protege4 and reasoning==

* Protege 3.4.1 is the recommended editor for OBI. However you may find that you are not able to classify OBI with its Pellet default reasoner. Instead using Protege 4 with the Pellet 2 reasoner is working. Do NOT edit with Protege 4, only view and classify the ontology. Edits must be made in 3.4. As of March 2010 classifiication is working with 3.4.1 and Pellet 1.5.2. Should classification fail to complete please report to the obi-dev list

* Installing Protege 4: choose the installer that "includes Java VM", and when the installer asks, choose to install a VM for protege rather than using the installed default.  

* Opening OBI (DO NOT EDIT) with protege 4. 

You cannot click on the .pprj file in this case. Instead check out OBI from the SVN to a local copy (see instructions above). We recommend you have a local sandbox directory so you can edit a local copy without accidentally checking back in your local copy to the OBI SVN. 

#Start protege 4

#29/9/09 - changes have been made to stop importing IAO obsolete terms
#Therefore do a fresh checkout, add a new line to the .repository file ../external/iao/iao-main.owl?forceReadOnly=true
#You may need to assign Protege more memory. Details here http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/Setting_Heap_Size. Then start Protege 4
#Choose open owl ontology
#Select obi.owl from your local copy of OBI obi\obi\trunk\src\ontology\branches - this is an OBI owl file with the imports present locally so you should not need to resolve these manually.
#When tested on 12 Aug 09 protege-dc failed to import, this can be imported locally by selecting the appropriate OWL protege-dc.owl file from your local copy of OBI -  obi\obi\trunk\src\ontology\external
#To get the class labels rather than the OBI ids to display select 'preferences' from the 'file' menu (protege menu on mac), Choose the renderer tab. Choose 'render entitities using annotation values' and OK.
#You should now be able to see OBI class labels rather than ids.
#Ensure everything is being loaded locally, rather than from the web - check menu 'File' 'Loaded Ontology Sources' Everything should be loaded from files, so add to "ontology libraries"  3 local directories branches, external, external/iao
#Click on the classes tab to see OBI classes and you are ready to classify
#Choose 'Reasoner', FACT++ is the default reasoner, however download Pellet 2, choose file, preferences, click the plugin tab, select Pellet 2, and it will be available after a Protege restart. Once you select Pellet then classification will start.
#This should be 2-4 minutes depending on the machine you are running on
#After the ONTIE merge Aug 2009, Pellet 2 classifies in a couple of minutes.
#A new tab will appear - 'inferred hierarchy' - enjoy.

==Release==

The current OBI release process is documented [http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0Acx6Blq96uycZHpwcm5td18xM256aHBmd2Z4&hl=en&invite=CKGzoJoE here] You may need to request edit privs to this document

We are considering to move OBI release using JAVA based program. [[release_notes | Here]] are discussion about it.

==MIREOT==

MIREOT refers to the way that terms are imported into OBI from an external ontology e.g, Chebi retaining their namespace.

==Obsoletion==

See policy http://obi-ontology.org/page/OBI_Deprecation_Policy  , IMPORTANT, deprecated terms need to be advertised to the list prior to deprecation, see policy link


Step by step:

Checkout a fresh update of OBI, open in 3.4.1

1. remove any child classes of your term-to-be-deprecated to sensible parent, drag and drop one by one

2. add reason for deprecation property to the term-to-be-deprecated  - use the widget - scroll down in the class editor, and select a term from the list e.g. failed exploratory term

3. add replacement term property if there is one

4. add prefix to rdfs label obsolete_

5. remove from existing parent class

6. add Obsolete parent class

7. remove any logical definitions and check used by in Protege. Click the blue arrow icon left on class editor panel. This will tell you if your term-to-be-deprecated is used in any other classes. You need to remove these as well.

8. save 

9. open and reason over in p4, check consistency - if you leave the old parent and the obolste one will generate an inconsistency

10. if OK check in as a new file with an svn log

<hr>

===Instances===

To edit OBI instances e.g. for the investigation use case

1. Click on the obi.pprj file - this will open the OWL file in 3.4.1 and will render all properties etc with rdfs labels

2. Click on the meta data tab, select the instances file e.g. Investigation-use-case.owl

3. Pencil icon should be active, if not go to OWL tab, ontology repositories and deselect read only for the relevant file. If you need to add a class then you'll be editing the obi.owl so repeat the process for selecting the active ontology but select the obi.owl file. 

4. Navigate to the instances tab. Instances for a given class are shown, unless click on owl thing when all are shown. Choose the class you want instances for and add these

4. To add an instance - click on the diamond with a plus - this will add instances for the selected class. Add rdfs labels, definitions, restrictions etc. 

5. Save and reason over in p4 before committing, if you've edited classes and instances commit both the obi.owl and investigation-use-case.owl
