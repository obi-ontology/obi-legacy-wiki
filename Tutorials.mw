A) Install latest Protege 3.4.X version from 
http://protege.stanford.edu/download/registered.html 

B) Install an svn client. For windows, we recommend 
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ 

C) Using the svn client, check out 
http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology 
(If you want to commit changes back to the repository, you will need to use
https: instead of http:, and will need a sourceforge password for obi.)

D) Go to the directory: ontology\branches and remove the '.template' 
extension from the files obi.owl, obi.pprj, obi.repository

E) open the obi.pprj file in protege
(double clicking works on windows)


'''How to get an OBI sourceforge access'''

1. First, you need to have a sourceforge.net account. If you do not have one, register at sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/account/registration/ .

2. Second, email one of the OBI sourceforge administrators (e.g., Melanie) as seen in the OBI sourceforge site. Alternatively,  email the obi developer mailing list (obi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). You will very likely be issued the right to access OBI sourceforge. This will allow you to make changes in OBI sourceforge.
