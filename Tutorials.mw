==Checkout==


A) Install latest Protege 3.4.X version from 
http://protege.stanford.edu/download/registered.html 

B) Install an svn client. For windows, we recommend 
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ 

C) Using the svn client, check out 
http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology 
(If you want to commit changes back to the repository, you will need to use
https: instead of http:, and will need a sourceforge password for obi.)

D) Go to the directory: ontology\branches and remove the '.template' 
extension from the files obi.owl, obi.pprj, obi.repository

E) open the obi.pprj file in protege
(double clicking works on windows)

==Sourceforge==

1. First, you need to have a sourceforge.net account. If you do not have one, register at sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/account/registration/ .

2. Second, email one of the OBI sourceforge administrators listed OBI sourceforge site. Alternatively,  email the obi developer mailing list (obi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). You will very likely be issued the right to access OBI sourceforge. This will allow you to make changes in OBI sourceforge.

==Reasoning==

This document was originally a [http://docs.google.com/View?id=dzprnmw_71chch6pfk google doc]

''Authors: Melanie Courtot, Alan Ruttenberg [http://groups.google.com/group/obi-developer/browse_thread/thread/94292461fca2a907?hl=en# - Alan's google group page''] and Helen Parkinson.

The aim is to detect problems with the OWL file that cause OBI to reason slowly. Some use of axioms prevents this. The application described provides some support for detecting and visualising these cases and some usage examples are included here.


===Step 1===

<nowiki> Load the kb and collect information. The take-sample function
takes a kb, a number of seconds for the reasoner to run, and the sort
key for presenting the results (one of "Time", "depth" (of the tree) ,
"size" (number of nodes)).
</nowiki>

===Step 2===

(setq kb (load-kb-jena :obil))

Output should be: 
<nowiki>

#<Pellet KB on file:///Users/mcourtot/Desktop/OBI/SVN/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/obil.owl>

</nowiki>

Note: to use the above you need to set obil in lsw/trunk/owl/standard-ontologies.lisp

<nowiki>
(take-sample kb 60 "Time")
</nowiki>

It runs and prints out a sorted list of the classes that it had time
to check. Here is what it looks like now:

*((("http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/OBI_0000153"
*  ("cell co-culturing"))
* ("depth" "18") ("size" "11882") ("Time" "7564"))

*....

===Step 3===

Pick some culprit near the top, compute the tree, and have a look at it.

=> setq assigns to the variable a the value of the expression between parenthesis

The function:

<nowiki>

(make-completion-graph a 5)


=> using the variable a that has been set up previously, a, give me the graph with a depth of 5

</nowiki>

Draws a radial layout tree to depth 5. Between 3 and 6 to be tolerable values depending on how cluttered the result is.


[http://docs.google.com/File?id=dzprnmw_72fjqqjfcp_b Radial layout image]
<hr>

Each node is formatted as
*"label:
*class
*class
*class
..."

The label is either "Class:" for the focus class, or the name of the
relation of the parent individual to the node. The classes are a list
of the most specific named classes based on looking only at asserted
superclass relations.

As you mouse over, the node under your mouse is red, direct parents
and children are yellow. Clicking on node brings up an inspector that
lists all the class expressions that are assigned to the node. 


[http://docs.google.com/File?id=dzprnmw_73g88dgnfd_b Visualization of the ontology]

===Step 4===

You then look around for nonsense. Some nonsense are relations to types of individuals that don't make sense in the context. For instance, in the image below, it doesn't make sense that we are seeing something about specified output data when we are describing a quality. The focus class is "fixed" and it's definition is

<nowiki>quality_of some ('material entity'  and is_specified_output_of some
'cell fixation')</nowiki>

So the first two nodes out from "fixed" are first an instance of quality, and second that cell fixation process. The fact that from that cell fixation process there is has_specified_output_data: datum
means that we haven't said that processes such as cell fixation don't have output data.

Another pattern is one where we see a property and then it's inverse immediately asserted (and again perhaps).  Picture 21, attached, shows such a case of dueling is_specified_output_of/has_specified_output. Poking around I think this is due to artifact object:is_specified_output_of some 'artifact material creation' and

[http://docs.google.com/File?id=dzprnmw_74gdn84cth_b image output]

If we get rid of the axiom on artifact material creation and reload, we get:


<nowiki>

(setq a  (check-entity-consistency !obi:OBI_0302851 kb t))
#<completion for consistency check of 'fixed' !obi:OBI_0302851 5980 nodes>

</nowiki>

The tree is 1/3 smaller. Such a change will typically affect many nodes, so you might see a surprising increase in reasoning speed for a small change such as this.

===Common Errors===

Missing disjoints, incorrectly broad ranges for properties, and these uses of
properties/inverse where we might be able to choose one direction and
stick with it.

In the shortest term, I think adding disjoints among the objective
specifications might help. I think I made those changes and saw effect
but I've been messing around with the files enough that I don't want
to save them and I don't have a good diff tool handy.


==Protege4==

* Protege 3.4 is the recommended editor for OBI. However you may find that you are not able to classify OBI with its Pellet default reasoner. In this case classification with FACT++ using Protege 4 may work. Do NOT edit with Protege 4, only view and classify the ontology. Edits must be made in 3.4. 

* Opening OBI with protege 4. 

You cannot click on the .pprj file in this case. Instead check out OBI from the SVN to a local copy (see instructions above). We recommend you have a local sandbox directory so you can edit a local copy without accidentally checking back in your local copy to the OBI SVN. 

#Start protege 4
#Choose open owl ontology
#Select obil.owl - this is an OBI owl file with the imports present locally so you should not need to resolve these manually.
#When tested on 12 Aug 09 protege-dc failed to import, this can be imported locally by selecting the appropriate OWL protege-dc.owl file from obi\obi\trunk\src\ontology\external
#To get the class labels rather than the OBI ids to display select 'preferences' from the 'file' menu, Choose the renderer tab. Choose 'render entitities using annotation values' and OK.
#You should now be able to see OBI class labels rather than ids.
#Click on the classes tab to see OBI classes and you are ready to classify
#Choose 'Reasoner', FACT++ is the default reasoner, click 'classify'
#A new tab will appear - 'inferred hierarchy'
