==Checkout==


A) Install latest Protege 3.4.1 version from 
http://protege.stanford.edu/download/registered.html 

B) Install an svn client. For windows, we recommend 
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ 

C) Using the svn client, check out 
http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology 
(If you want to commit changes back to the repository, you will need to use
https: instead of http:, and will need a sourceforge password for obi.)

D) Go to the directory: ontology\branches and remove the '.template' 
extension from the files obi.owl, obi.pprj, obi.repository

E) open the obi.pprj file in protege
(double clicking works on windows)

F)If you are editing OBI we are now working with a merged file rather than a series of branch files therefore:

* You MUST edit in 3.4.1

* Do an SVN update of your local repository prior to editing

* Send email to the devel list before checking out, after checking in

* Keep edits short

==Sourceforge==

1. First, you need to have a sourceforge.net account. If you do not have one, register at sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/account/registration/ .

2. Second, email one of the OBI sourceforge administrators listed OBI sourceforge site. Alternatively,  email the obi developer mailing list (obi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). You will very likely be issued the right to access OBI sourceforge. This will allow you to make changes in OBI sourceforge.

==Reasoning==

 [http://docs.google.com/View?id=dzprnmw_71chch6pfk google doc explaining a diagnotics application]

''Authors: Melanie Courtot, Alan Ruttenberg [http://groups.google.com/group/obi-developer/browse_thread/thread/94292461fca2a907?hl=en# - Alan's google group page''] and Helen Parkinson.

The aim is to detect problems with the OWL file that cause OBI to reason slowly. Some use of axioms prevents this. The application described provides some support for detecting and visualising these cases and some usage examples are included here. It's bleeding edge, contact Alan for details on usage, or see the google doc link above.

==Protege4==

* Protege 3.4 is the recommended editor for OBI. However you may find that you are not able to classify OBI with its Pellet default reasoner. In this case classification with FACT++ using Protege 4 may work. Do NOT edit with Protege 4, only view and classify the ontology. Edits must be made in 3.4. 

* Opening OBI with protege 4. 

You cannot click on the .pprj file in this case. Instead check out OBI from the SVN to a local copy (see instructions above). We recommend you have a local sandbox directory so you can edit a local copy without accidentally checking back in your local copy to the OBI SVN. 

#Start protege 4
#Choose open owl ontology
#Select obil.owl from your local copy of OBI obi\obi\trunk\src\ontology\branches - this is an OBI owl file with the imports present locally so you should not need to resolve these manually.
#When tested on 12 Aug 09 protege-dc failed to import, this can be imported locally by selecting the appropriate OWL protege-dc.owl file from your local copy of OBI -  obi\obi\trunk\src\ontology\external
#To get the class labels rather than the OBI ids to display select 'preferences' from the 'file' menu, Choose the renderer tab. Choose 'render entitities using annotation values' and OK.
#You should now be able to see OBI class labels rather than ids.
#Click on the classes tab to see OBI classes and you are ready to classify
#Choose 'Reasoner', FACT++ is the default reasoner, click 'classify' - this should be fast >2 minutes.
#A new tab will appear - 'inferred hierarchy' - enjoy.


==Release==

The current OBI release process is documented [http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0Acx6Blq96uycZHpwcm5td18xM256aHBmd2Z4&hl=en&invite=CKGzoJoE here] You may need to request edit privs to this document
