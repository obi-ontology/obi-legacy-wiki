** Don't try to log in, instead choose "Attend a meeting"
** Meeting code: OBIVowWK
** Enter your email address, click "attend" and you should get connected.
** Centra can be flaky on a Mac, use web version rather than the desktop - choose launch in browser
** Centra requires some SW to be installed, so it's worth checking that this is all up to date before joing a call, can take several mins. 

* Directions to use the voice feature
** make sure you have a microphone
** hold down the "person talking" icon in the upper right while you talk (clicking isn't enough)
** if you are talking for a long time, you can use the adjacent "lock" icone (which you can clck on/off). However, this keeps otheres from speaking so don't leave it on and watch out for others who want to respond ("hand up" icon next to their name).
* Directions to share an application for all those logged in
** Click on 'Share Application' in the top menu of Centra
*** To promote someone to presenter, right-click over the person to promote to co-presenter and select 'promote to co-presenter'
