==Thursday Janury 31 Notes==

==Discussion on managing input to OBI==
* How to keep track
* How to summarize emails
* How to communicate previous decisions
* What is the social enforcement
* Suggestions
    * use the tracker
    * use a new tracker like the OWL tracker
    * use annotation properties in OWL
    * branch editors summarize 
    * proposer summarizes
    * how do we document the conclusion

<b>AI:
* Summary editor note in OWL file, can point to external URL if needed
* Summary should be in text use SVN change log note to say what has been changed as well. 
* Use <i>Editor Note</i> if becomes too complex in the OWL file these can be stripped out, next release will have 2 files, one with E. note one without
* Doesn't need to be done retrospectively
* This relies on a usable and used deprecation policy
* A tracker will be used instead of email for tracking issues, this will be SF until a decision is made
* We will look at new tracker options due to SF issues, will be added to a future developers call, options trac, w3c, sf. A wiki vote page will be set up by JM
* If something comes to dev-list, it can be referred to a branch instead
* When proposing an item in tracker we will discuss on dev call, it will be assigned to a person, and that person will take responsibility for resolving discussion and closing
</b>


E.g. if change analyte, commit -analyte changed. Editor note, summary of why. Point to wiki, or thread. Typo fixes do not need to be logged. 



MC:People should be allowed an opinion, but need to know what the decision was. E.g a tracker.

RB:OBI file is the arbitrator - curation complete= a decision

BB:and we have annotation properties for discussion, and we can add there

SS:issue that this on the call.

PRS:branch leader to add an editor note in the file

HP:tracker works well for a small no of editors, but release notes would be better and can generate these from the file

BB:related thing, no-one can bring up a topic unless they provide a solution and they document it's closure.

AR:I have been adding release notes on checkin, and there's a mailing list on checkin, and there's a log. This not at the level of definitions

MC:In OWL file is great, some things did not make it to the OWL file

BP:we didn't have the OWL file in the early days, now we can force people to use it

<b>AI:Two proposals for this, OWL file annotation property and SVN checkin logs</b>

AR:we could get tracker from W3C - XG Incubator

BP:2 things, we won't have the resolution in the OWL file, and that's fine. We need the resolution, discussion conclusion as an annotation property

RB:could you enumerate the trackers Alan?

AR:using a tracker consistently would be better

BB:most big projects have the tracker linked to the SVN

AR:we should look at the OWL tracker, and see if use XG instead

RB:Look at OWL tracker now http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/tracker/ integrates into your emails

HP:this is a social problem not a technology problem

BP:do we need a new tracker/svn link?

AR:now that we have the google groups, people can use google groups for everything, is mirrored

<b>AI:</b>

* Should we be a W3C group?
    * we need to have three W3C supporters
    * get telecon
    * get webspace
    * use of tracker
    * need an editor
    * benefit for community

<b>AI:AR will look into what are committing to in becoming a W3C group</b>

* Process needed for decision making

* Time lag is one month on votes - long
<b>AI:Proposal: We will now have 2 week deadlines on anything that is put to the vote - JM will make a wiki to vote</b>

* Who is responsible for a thread closure?

BB:suggest that someone on the branch takes responsibility. I will not do that again, no resolution

MC:I started analyte. I am happy to resolve, what if people disagree

RB:Work through an example: If we started today, add to sf, proposed a solution, then I assign to. During dev call go through unassigned issues, deadline set and someone owns.
