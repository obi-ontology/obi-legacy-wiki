==Thursday Janury 31 Notes==

==Discussion on managing input to OBI
* How to keep track
* How to summarize emails
* How to communicate previous decisions

MC:People should be allowed an opinion, but need to know what the decision was. E.g a tracker.

RB:OBI file is the arbitrator - curation complete= a decision

BB:and we have annotation properties for discussion, and we can add there

SS:issue that this on the call.

PRS:branch leader to add an editor note in the file

HP:tracker works well for a small no of editors, but release notes would be better and can generate these from the file

BB:related thing, no-one can bring up a topic unless they provide a solution and they document it's closure.

AR:I have been adding release notes on checkin, and there's a mailing list on checkin, and there's a log. This not at the level of definitions

MC:In OWL file is great, some things did not make it to the OWL file

BP:we didn't have the OWL file in the early days, now we can force people to use it

<b>AI:Two proposals for this, OWL file annotation property and SVN checkin logs</b>

AR:we could get tracker from W3C - XG Incubator

BP:2 things, we won't have the resolution in the OWL file, and that's fine. We need the resolution, discussion conclusion as an annotation property

RB:could you enumerate the trackers Alan?

AR:using a tracker consistently would be better

BB:most big projects have the tracker linked to the SVN
