==Action Items Vancouver==

These are extracted from the notes for each day and listed here

==Emerging Action Items, Monday==
<b>AI: AR/BP/BS - will refine the analyte proposal. There are placement issues to resolve.

AI: AR/BB/JF - BB will produce a TRUE role subset of the INOH Molecular Role ontology, which AR will review, and pass on to JF.

AI: Send Enviroment Ontology related terms to BS for him to present in Manchester, esp. RS

AI:Richard to communicate with Suzi Lewis and Chris Mungall on OBD future, overlap syngeries with OBI

AI:AR,BD will go to the relations ontology meeting in Denver to present our needs

AI:Relation Branch will develop a way to make it clear for relations using an annotation property (or similar) to make it clear which relations can be used at class and which can be used at instance level. This constraint is needed 

AI:BP and AR will try and develop ProtocolApplication from Plan to evaluate whether this can be done automatically

AI:Protocol and ProtocolApplication branches will be merged

AI:Produce an example a Protocol acquired into ProtocolApplication from ArrayExpress - HP

AI:RS will provide a clinical trial example of protocol

AI:HP will produce an example from ArrayExpress Protocol->ProtocolApplication

AI:How do we embed OBI in different systems - AR wants as focus of a session this week

AI:Alan will generate a list of problems and solutions with DENRI for discussion on a conference call

AI:BS will provide a better name for MeasurementUnit as Units pre-exist in the world outside data and so the name is bad.

AI:BS will provide an example of function/role that doesn't involve doubling up with role and functions

AI:Organization needs a place in the ontology, not yet determined

AI:JW will provide a link for PDBs effort to do this for beamlines

AI:Make the connection between the visulation here between table and graph that comes out of this process currently that is in the DENRI branch

AI: DT branch will consider using objective, not role for e.g. normalization - might make things easier and practical consequences will not be huge: DT branch, Protocol

AI:Role is confusing and all the discussions will be distilled by BS and AR for clarity

AI:BS will devolve organization ontology, document ontology and information entity to a new ontology in the future, these are too high level for OBI

AI:BB will send the link to his modified BirnLex SW ontology to the data transformation branch

AI:AR will post the OBO release policy document and people will offer comment on if this is a good policy for OBI
</b>
=========================================================================================
==Emerging Action Items Tuesday==

<b>
AI: Term problem solution sheet to be generated by RB to be sent to advisors if needed

AI: Develop a documentation plan for OBI and assign tasks JM/MC/BB. Deadline for docs and plan by March 1

AI: Branch/Individual review of other branches by March - all

AI: Develop a test plan for the OBI release, document and execute BB

AI:Take use cases and see if OBI can be used to complete these use cases, need some kind of template for this: NEEDS A DEADLINE DETERMINED BY END OF WEEK

* RS:Volunteer to do a use case clinical study

* RB:Flow cytometry use case

* JM/HP:ArrayExpress use case

* PRS/BII use case

* BB:BIRN use case

* JG:Immunity use case

* CS:JF SIFT use case

* GenePattern use case  (CS/HP)

AI: Developing a long term (5 year) management plan for the OBI grant - AR/BP/BS

AI:Find the original doc for authorship policy and take to a coord conference call when we have a paper in draft CS


AI:Develop a use case that shows cross database integration using OBI and add a milestone for the long term plan - needs volunteers

AI:OBI coordinators should nominate 1 or 2 people to be OBI associate editors - agenda item for a coordinators call CS

AI:InformationEntity will be renamed plan, synonym RealizableInformationEntity DONE

AI:Edit:DigitalEntity->kid of NonRealizableInfoEntity, Plan will be a sibling of NonRealizeableInfoEntity, both children of InfoEntity DONE

Disjointness, currently incomplete. AR will strip all out and script adding back in. Al will be pairwise DJ apart from a couple of places in BFO where it's fuzzy AR

AI:Definition of InformationEntity to be done by BS/AR/BB

AI:EDIT:Objective now child of InfoEntity DONE

AI:EDIT:Define Objective add a definition, synonym is GOAL DONE

AI:Resolve the difference between Investigation and ProtocolApplication - BP suggests that PA never tests a hypothesis and that Investigations can have hypotheses

AI:to prepare a better definition for assay based on the discussion and convince Alan that it is always a dependent continuant. Assay has been redefined in the OWL file in an approx way

AI:EDIT:evaluant is added as a role, RS will make a definition. It's the thing being evaluated

<i>DEF:An evaluant_role is the role played by a portion of material (including specimens and human subjects) that serves as the subject of study in an assay such that the output data describes a feature (quality..... e.g. "contains 10 pg/ml IL2") of the evaluant.</i>


AI:Edit:re-defined material transformation - added to OWL file. .. is a protocol application where the objective is to produce output material from input material' DONE

AI:Edit:Check the definition of DataTransformation, MaterialTransformation, and all children of PA (except waiting moved) reworded for consistency. PA also redefined in terms of bring about objective of a protocol - DONE

AI:Edit:waiting was moved next to acclimatization and is no longer a child of PA DONE. Needs to be resolved when time representation is resolved (not done)

AI:TIME - needs to be discussed and a proposal produced for representing temporal events, waiting etc in OBI

AI:PRS will put together something for discussion on Plan, PA and Protocol - will be discussed later this week

AI:MC will write up the discussion on Role, Function and what we understand for distribution and we will then develop a consensus on going forward on this. No consensus reached yet.

AI:BS will resolve BFO issues reported to him, all examples will be resolved by May 4 2008

AI:BS/AR to explain why roles cannot be born by processes

AI:update naming conventions page to allow this case of suffix role being allowed in this special case

AI:Susanna to supply subtype of compound role toxin etc to Jennifer

AI:Philippe to make a list of obi roles that should be in chebi

AI:Define hospital when do organization

<b>AI:no resolution on processes being bearers of roles, needs to be resolved, issues also with roles, propositions and variables</b>

<b>AR/BS will discuss relation proposal or the new term proposal for variable in study design</b>

<b>AI:types can bear quality like things features and mathematical function and this is a workaround here for math entities. Outside BFO so needs to be OBI and would mean that we don't need a relation. New class called feature - has_feature relates a type to a feature, all base, degree and number are features of type. DT branch and CC will look into this asap. 21 Feb 2008. Alan will call in as will BS.</b> 
</b>

<b>AI:branch OK relation branch terms will be sent to RO2</b>

<b>AI:BS will review relations s/sheet and document the approach for dealing with has_model that need to be represented in OBI</b>

<b>AI:BS will review relations s/sheet and document the approach for dealing with has_model that need to be represented in OBI</b>

<b>AI:issue that we need a quality like thing of gifness. could also be solved by using feature om OBI as above, again a work around BS:</b>

<b>AI:branches to prioritize which relations are needed and tell role branch</b>

<b>AI:We will need to deal with Parameters, probably in instrument</b>

<b>AI:JW to look at use case docs and suggest some for stuctural biology</b>
