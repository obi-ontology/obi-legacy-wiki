*DL:May 19

AI:Relation Branch will develop a way to make it clear for relations using an annotation property (or similar) to make it clear which relations can be used at class and which can be used at instance level. This constraint is needed. 
*DL:Mar 1 (enter into tracker)

AI: Develop a documentation plan for OBI and assign tasks JM/MC/BB. 
*DL:Mar 1 for a plan

AI: Branch/Individual review of other branches by March
*DL:Mar 15

AI: Develop a test plan for the OBI release, document and execute BB
*DL:Mar 15 (second release)

AI:Definition of InformationEntity to be done by BS/AR/BB
*DL:Mar 1

AI:Resolve the difference between Investigation and ProtocolApplication - BP suggests that PA never tests a hypothesis and that Investigations can have hypotheses
*DL:

AI:BS to prepare a better definition for assay based on the discussion and convince Alan that it is always a dependent continuant. Assay has been redefined in the OWL file in an approx way
*DL:Mar 1

AI:EDIT:evaluant is added as a role, RS will make a definition. It's the thing being evaluated
<i>DEF:An evaluant_role is the role played by a portion of material (including specimens and human subjects) that serves as the subject of study in an assay such that the output data describes a feature (quality..... e.g. "contains 10 pg/ml IL2") of the evaluant.</i>
*DL:Def done, needs to be added to Tracker by Mar 1



AI:Edit:waiting was moved next to acclimatization and is no longer a child of PA DONE. Needs to be resolved when time representation is resolved (not done)
*DL:? Summer workshop

AI:TIME - needs to be discussed and a proposal produced for representing temporal events, waiting etc in OBI
*DL:?Summer workshop

AI:PRS will put together something for discussion on Plan, PA and Protocol - will be discussed later this week (Plan and PA branch work will be merged into a single effort)
*DL:Mar 1

*DL:Mar 1

AI:Hospital should be added when Organization is added to OBI
*DL:?

AI:issues also with propositions and roles unresolved
DL?

AR/BS will discuss relation proposal or the new term proposal for variable in study design
*DL:?

AI:types can bear quality like things features and mathematical function and this is a workaround here where classes are created in OBI for math entities. Outside BFO so needs to be OBI and would mean that we don't need a relation. New class called feature - has_feature relates a type to a feature, all base, degree and number are features of type. DT branch and CC, AR, BS. 
*DL:21 Feb phone call

AI:branch OK relation branch terms will be sent to RO2
*DL:?

AI:BS will review relations s/sheet and document the approach for dealing with has_model that need to be represented in OBI
*DL:?

AI:BS will review relations s/sheet and document the approach for dealing with has_model that need to be represented in OBI
*DL:?

AI:issue that we need a quality like thing of gifness. could also be solved by using feature om OBI as above, again a work around BS:
*DL:?

AI:branches to prioritize which relations are needed and tell role branch
*DL:Mar 1

AI:We will need to deal with Parameters, use cases from Instrument, will be in qualities
*DL:?

AI:move hypothesis, dt role, stat factor from role, add under new class specification suggest a new role - specifies? Plan/PA branch
*DL:?

AI:processes can't bear roles, objective is used instead for e.g. negative control - add to tracker. JF
*DL:Mar 1


AI:BS will send out some notes on logical definitions for instance level relations to relations branch to prevent relation explosion.
*DL:?

AI:communities to send terms to instrument branch to improve coverage. BB will send an OWL file for BIRN microscopy and imaging
BB:Mar 1

AI:Edit:suggested edit new class role assignment with group assignment underneath it if PA can be distinct from a Planned Process
*DL:Mar 1

AI:Edit:Defintion of PA defined as being carried out to modify or generate data or materials in an investigation
*DL:? did this get done

AI:discuss within Instrument branch consequences for making artefact object a defined class only to avoid problems where there are biomaterials that are also human generated.
*DL:Mar 1

OR can we could keep artefact object and add classes underneath it use this strategy only for biomaterials, as we think all instruments will be artefact objects. Would be weird to have instrument next to protein. MC will communicate to instrument branch. Biomaterial branch are going with the defined class and will use reasoner to place terms in h'archy e.g. under artifact object and some other parent

AI:use roles for e.g. buffer in (bio)material rather than hierarchy - BioMaterial Branch
*DL:Mar 1

AI: proposal how to define material: material is union of BFO object, BFP object aggregate, BFO fiat object part. Is now the root for biomaterial and artifact which are defined classes and will help OBI be multi granular
*DL:Mar 1


AI:biomaterial will attempt define these in vivo etc as a defined class and see if this works, these may be at assay level not material level, and these will likely be processes 
*DL:Mar 1

AI:DT can do the gating examples as a defined class into the ontology - branch action item
*DL:?

AI:Alan to write up an OBI import/mapping strategy doc as described at the workshop 
*DL:Mar 1

AI:AR/JM/MC will work through a use case with the cell type ontology import needed for biomaterial and test this strategy and report on the results. This will be an OBI application ontology as soon as we start bringing into OBI 
*DL:? Summer workshop

AI:develop a strategy for dealing with the OBO foundry ontologies and OBI application ontology if import works
*DL:? Summer workshop

AI:Ontology annotation and release notes policy
* Summary editor note in OWL file, can point to external URL if needed
* Summary should be in text use SVN change log note to say what has been changed as well. 
* Use <i>Editor Note</i> if becomes too complex in the OWL file these can be stripped out, next release will have 2 files, one with E. note one without
* Doesn't need to be done retrospectively
* This relies on a
  * usable and used deprecation policy
  * A tracker will be used instead of email for tracking issues, this will be SF until a decision is made
  * We will look at new tracker options due to SF issues, will be added to a future developers call, options trac, w3c, sf. A wiki vote page will be set up by JM
  * If something comes to dev-list, it can be referred to a branch instead
  * When proposing an item in tracker we will discuss on dev call, assign a date for closure, it will be assigned to a person, and that person will take responsibility for resolving discussion and closing on the due date decided.
  * If you have tracker things from this meeting (look for your initials) use the tracker
*DL:Mar 1 for outstanding items to be added to tracker e.g. analyte, policy is DONE.

AI:Two proposals for release notes, OWL file annotation property and SVN checkin logs

*DL: 13 Feb, next coord call

AI:Identify what the responsibilities are for a coordinator and a community representative - Coord Call. CS
*DL:13 Feb, next coord call

AI:Things get voted on in wiki by proposing a vote on a dev call
*DL:n/a policy

AI:if consensus cannot be reached by developers, coordinating will decide by some as yet undefined mechanism
*DL:n/a policy

AI:Deprecation policy will be discussed on next coordinators call to allow others to comments. AR Proposal for discussion is that we use OBO foundry process, add an obsolete class. Issues with logical definitions and previous use of editor note for this CS
*DL:13 Feb, next coord call

AI:Paper proposal on engineering methodology to provide an incentive
*DL:?

AI:custom google custom search box for OBI wiki will be requested from CS group CS
*DL:something has been DONE what?



AI:DENRI, Relations, Quality, Role need links to their term list files and or notes on the Branch Conf Calls
*DL:DONE ?

AI:When call minutes done, sent to list for branch or dev, coord, and name minutes from that date and that branch - All branch editor and or person hosting dev or coord call
*DL:immediate effect

AI:Dealing with multi branch issues - if these exist they will go into tracker and hence a dev call
*DL:Mar 1, for existing items to be added to tracker

AI:General feeling that there is no design whereby computing over h'archy depth is designed into OBI and it's not a good way to work with OBI at present MC will speak to EM about this
*DL:Mar 1

AI:An underscore will be added to each branches helper classes, each branch will deal with this themselves
*DL:Mar 1

AI:MC will add stimulus to the tracker
*DL:Mar 1

AI:Bioportal should point at the most recent version OBI-OWL merged file release so that progress is visible. We could release every 2 weeks, point at what changes in change log. Could be pull or push. CS
*DL:15 Feb for mechanism, upload after Mar 1

Bi-weekly releases of the OBI merged file will be made in SVN, it will be versioned less than 1.0). This will require unit tests from Bill (another AI from this workshop), will be in OWL-DL, likely this will mean use of pellet. Will be released on 1 and 15 of each Month. First release will be on March 1. For release it must classify in pellet at a minimum. This will be a per 1.0 release. JG will provide his an xls version as well BB, MC, CK, JG
*DL:Mar 1, first release

Coordinators/Core Dev will review March 1 release and any issues will be added to track for resolution
*DL:Mar 15


AI:We need the criteria that define what is the prioritization for issues and if nec. we take it to a vote for e.g.  Mar 1 release, depends on CS mail to coordinators. SS will mail CS so that we can make the time line work. 
*DL:13 Feb

AI:BP and AR will try and develop ProtocolApplication from Plan to evaluate whether this can be done automatically
*DL:?

AI:Protocol and ProtocolApplication branches will be merged. The OWL files for Plan, Protocol have been merged by AR. He will send instructions to the dev list
*DL:DONE, files merged, need a decision on list

AI:Produce an example a Protocol acquired into ProtocolApplication from ArrayExpress - HP

*DL:Mar 1

AI:Make the connection between the visulation here between table and graph that comes out of this process currently that is in the DENRI branch
*DL:?

AI: DT branch will consider using objective, not role for e.g. normalization - might make things easier and practical consequences will not be huge: DT branch, Protocol
*DL:Mar 1

AI:Role is confusing and all the discussions will be distilled by BS and AR for clarity
*DL:?

AI:BS will devolve organization ontology, document ontology and information entity to a new ontology in the future, these are too high level for OBI
*DL:?

AI:BB will send the link to his modified BirnLex SW ontology to the data transformation branch
*DL:6 Feb

AI:AI: John will provide us with top-level hierarchy (low number of terms) for incorporation into OBI.
