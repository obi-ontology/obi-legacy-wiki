Emerging Action Items Tuesday==

<b>
AI: Term problem solution sheet to be generated by RB to be sent to advisors if needed

AI: Develop a documentation plan for OBI and assign tasks JM/MC/BB. Deadline for docs and plan by March 1

AI: Branch/Individual review of other branches by March - all

AI: Develop a test plan for the OBI release, document and execute BB

AI:Take use cases and see if OBI can be used to complete these use cases, need some kind of template for this: NEEDS A DEADLINE DETERMINED BY END OF WEEK

* RS:Volunteer to do a use case clinical study

* RB:Flow cytometry use case

* JM/HP:ArrayExpress use case

* PRS/BII use case

* BB:BIRN use case

* JG:Immunity use case

* CS:JF SIFT use case

* GenePattern use case  (CS/HP)

AI: Developing a long term (5 year) management plan for the OBI grant - AR/BP/BS

AI:Find the original doc for authorship policy and take to a coord conference call when we have a paper in draft CS


AI:Develop a use case that shows cross database integration using OBI and add a milestone for the long term plan - needs volunteers

AI:OBI coordinators should nominate 1 or 2 people to be OBI associate editors - agenda item for a coordinators call CS

AI:InformationEntity will be renamed plan, synonym RealizableInformationEntity DONE

AI:Edit:DigitalEntity->kid of NonRealizableInfoEntity, Plan will be a sibling of NonRealizeableInfoEntity, both children of InfoEntity DONE

Disjointness, currently incomplete. AR will strip all out and script adding back in. Al will be pairwise DJ apart from a couple of places in BFO where it's fuzzy AR

AI:Definition of InformationEntity to be done by BS/AR/BB

AI:EDIT:Objective now child of InfoEntity DONE

AI:EDIT:Define Objective add a definition, synonym is GOAL DONE

AI:Resolve the difference between Investigation and ProtocolApplication - BP suggests that PA never tests a hypothesis and that Investigations can have hypotheses

AI:to prepare a better definition for assay based on the discussion and convince Alan that it is always a dependent continuant. Assay has been redefined in the OWL file in an approx way

AI:EDIT:evaluant is added as a role, RS will make a definition. It's the thing being evaluated

<i>DEF:An evaluant_role is the role played by a portion of material (including specimens and human subjects) that serves as the subject of study in an assay such that the output data describes a feature (quality..... e.g. "contains 10 pg/ml IL2") of the evaluant.</i>


AI:Edit:re-defined material transformation - added to OWL file. .. is a protocol application where the objective is to produce output material from input material' DONE

AI:Edit:Check the definition of DataTransformation, MaterialTransformation, and all children of PA (except waiting moved) reworded for consistency. PA also redefined in terms of bring about objective of a protocol - DONE

AI:Edit:waiting was moved next to acclimatization and is no longer a child of PA DONE. Needs to be resolved when time representation is resolved (not done)

AI:TIME - needs to be discussed and a proposal produced for representing temporal events, waiting etc in OBI

AI:PRS will put together something for discussion on Plan, PA and Protocol - will be discussed later this week

AI:MC will write up the discussion on Role, Function and what we understand for distribution and we will then develop a consensus on going forward on this. No consensus reached yet.

AI:BS will resolve BFO issues reported to him, all examples will be resolved by May 4 2008

AI:BS/AR to explain why roles cannot be born by processes

AI:update naming conventions page to allow this case of suffix role being allowed in this special case

AI:Susanna to supply subtype of compound role toxin etc to Jennifer

AI:Philippe to make a list of obi roles that should be in chebi

AI:Define hospital when do organization

<b>AI:no resolution on processes being bearers of roles, needs to be resolved, issues also with roles, propositions and variables</b>

<b>AR/BS will discuss relation proposal or the new term proposal for variable in study design</b>

<b>AI:types can bear quality like things features and mathematical function and this is a workaround here for math entities. Outside BFO so needs to be OBI and would mean that we don't need a relation. New class called feature - has_feature relates a type to a feature, all base, degree and number are features of type. DT branch and CC will look into this asap. 21 Feb 2008. Alan will call in as will BS.</b> 
</b>

<b>AI:branch OK relation branch terms will be sent to RO2</b>

<b>AI:BS will review relations s/sheet and document the approach for dealing with has_model that need to be represented in OBI</b>

<b>AI:BS will review relations s/sheet and document the approach for dealing with has_model that need to be represented in OBI</b>

<b>AI:issue that we need a quality like thing of gifness. could also be solved by using feature om OBI as above, again a work around BS:</b>

<b>AI:branches to prioritize which relations are needed and tell role branch</b>

<b>AI:We will need to deal with Parameters, probably in instrument</b>

<b>AI:JW to look at use case docs and suggest some for stuctural biology</b>
