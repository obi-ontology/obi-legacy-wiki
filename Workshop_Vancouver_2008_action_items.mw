==Action Items Vancouver==

These are extracted from the notes for each day and listed here

==Emerging Action Items, Monday==
<b>AI: AR/BP/BS - will refine the analyte proposal. There are placement issues to resolve.

AI: AR/BB/JF - BB will produce a TRUE role subset of the INOH Molecular Role ontology, which AR will review, and pass on to JF.

AI: Send Enviroment Ontology related terms to BS for him to present in Manchester, esp. RS

AI:Richard to communicate with Suzi Lewis and Chris Mungall on OBD future, overlap syngeries with OBI

AI:AR,BD will go to the relations ontology meeting in Denver to present our needs

AI:Relation Branch will develop a way to make it clear for relations using an annotation property (or similar) to make it clear which relations can be used at class and which can be used at instance level. This constraint is needed 


Emerging Action Items Tuesday==

<b>
AI: Term problem solution sheet to be generated by RB to be sent to advisors if needed

AI: Develop a documentation plan for OBI and assign tasks JM/MC/BB. Deadline for docs plan by March 1

AI: Branch/Individual review of other branches by March - all

AI: Develop a test plan for the OBI release, document and execute BB

AI:Take use cases and see if OBI can be used to complete these use cases, need some kind of template for this: Deadline May 1st for completion.

* RS:Volunteer to do a use case clinical study

* RB:Flow cytometry use case

* JM/HP:ArrayExpress use case

* PRS/BII use case

* BB:BIRN use case

* JG:Immunity use case

* CS:JF SIFT use case

* GenePattern use case  (CS/HP)

AI: Developing a long term (5 year) management plan for the OBI grant - AR/BP/BS

AI:Find the original doc for authorship policy and take to a coord conference call when we have a paper in draft CS

AI:Develop a use case that shows cross database integration using OBI and add a milestone for the long term plan - needs volunteers

AI:OBI coordinators should nominate 1 personto be OBI associate editors - agenda item for a coordinators call CS

AI:Edit:InformationEntity will be renamed plan, synonym RealizableInformationEntity DONE

AI:Edit:DigitalEntity->kid of NonRealizableInfoEntity, Plan will be a sibling of NonRealizeableInfoEntity, both children of InfoEntity DONE

Disjointness, currently incomplete. AR will strip all out and script adding back in. Al will be pairwise DJ apart from a couple of places in BFO where it's fuzzy AR/MC

AI:Definition of InformationEntity to be done by BS/AR/BB

AI:EDIT:Objective now child of InfoEntity DONE

AI:EDIT:Define Objective add a definition, synonym is GOAL DONE

AI:Resolve the difference between Investigation and ProtocolApplication - BP suggests that PA never tests a hypothesis and that Investigations can have hypotheses

AI:to prepare a better definition for assay based on the discussion and convince Alan that it is always a dependent continuant. Assay has been redefined in the OWL file in an approx way

AI:EDIT:evaluant is added as a role, RS will make a definition. It's the thing being evaluated

<i>DEF:An evaluant_role is the role played by a portion of material (including specimens and human subjects) that serves as the subject of study in an assay such that the output data describes a feature (quality..... e.g. "contains 10 pg/ml IL2") of the evaluant.</i>


AI:Edit:re-defined material transformation - added to OWL file. .. is a protocol application where the objective is to produce output material from input material' DONE

AI:Edit:Check the definition of DataTransformation, MaterialTransformation, and all children of PA (except waiting moved) reworded for consistency. PA also redefined in terms of bring about objective of a protocol - DONE

AI:Edit:waiting was moved next to acclimatization and is no longer a child of PA DONE. Needs to be resolved when time representation is resolved (not done)

AI:TIME - needs to be discussed and a proposal produced for representing temporal events, waiting etc in OBI

AI:PRS will put together something for discussion on Plan, PA and Protocol - will be discussed later this week (Plan and PA branch work will be merged into a single effort)

AI:MC will write up the discussion on Role, Function and what we understand for distribution and we will then develop a consensus on going forward on this. No consensus reached yet.

AI:BS will resolve BFO issues reported to him, all examples will be resolved by May 4 2008

AI:BS/AR to explain why roles cannot be born by processes. DONE. We will use objective of planned process to state e.g. variables and then processes such as sham surgery are do not need to be bearers of roles., the objective of a sham surgery control is the objective. The process is independent of this

AI: Daniel S to update naming conventions page to allow this case of suffix role being allowed in this special case

AI:Susanna to supply subtype of compound role toxin etc to Jennifer

AI:Philippe to make a list of obi roles that should be in chebi

AI:Hospital should be added when Organization is added to OBI

<b>AI:issues also with propositions and roles unresolved</b>

<b>AR/BS will discuss relation proposal or the new term proposal for variable in study design</b>

<b>AI:types can bear quality like things features and mathematical function and this is a workaround here where classes are created in OBI for math entities. Outside BFO so needs to be OBI and would mean that we don't need a relation. New class called feature - has_feature relates a type to a feature, all base, degree and number are features of type. DT branch and CC will look into this asap. 21 Feb 2008. Alan will call in as will BS.</b> 
</b>

<b>AI:branch OK relation branch terms will be sent to RO2</b>

<b>AI:BS will review relations s/sheet and document the approach for dealing with has_model that need to be represented in OBI</b>

<b>AI:BS will review relations s/sheet and document the approach for dealing with has_model that need to be represented in OBI</b>

<b>AI:issue that we need a quality like thing of gifness. could also be solved by using feature om OBI as above, again a work around BS:</b>

<b>AI:branches to prioritize which relations are needed and tell role branch</b>

<b>AI:We will need to deal with Parameters, use cases from Instrument, will be in qualities</b>

<b>AI:JW to look at use case docs and suggest some for stuctural biology</b>


==Action Items Wednesday==



*<b>AI:move hypothesis, dt role, stat factor from role, add under new class specification suggest a new role - specifies? Plan/PA branch</b>

*<b>AI:processes can't bear roles, objective is used instead for e.g. negative control - this has been added to the action item wiki</b>

*<b>AI:BS will send out some notes on logical definitions for instance level relations to relations branch to prevent relation explosion.</b>

*<b>AI:communities to send terms to instrument branch to improve coverage. BB will send an OWL file for BIRN microscopy and imaging</b>

*<b>AI:Edit:suggested edit new class role assignment with group assignment underneath it if PA can be distinct from a Planned Process</b>

*<b>AI:Edit:Defintion of PA defined as being carried out to modify or generate data or materials in an investigation</b>

*<b>AI:discuss within Instrument branch consequences for making artefact object a defined class only to avoid problems where there are biomaterials that are also human generated.

OR can we could keep artefact object and add classes underneath it use this strategy only for biomaterials, as we think all instruments will be artefact objects. Would be weird to have instrument next to protein. MC will communicate to instrument branch. Biomaterial branch are going with the defined class and will use reasoner to place terms in h'archy e.g. under artifact object and some other parent
</b>

*<b>AI:use roles for e.g. buffer in (bio)material rather than hierarchy - BioMaterial Branch</b>

*<b>AI: proposal how to define material: material is union of BFO object, BFP object aggregate, BFO fiat object part. Is now the root for biomaterial and artifact which are defined classes and will help OBI be multi granular</b>

*<b>AI:population now has material as a parent and not object aggregate as material is now a union of BFO things</b>

*<b>AI:biomaterial will attempt define these in vivo etc as a defined class and see if this works, these may be at assay level not material level, and these will likely be processes </b>

*<b>AI:DT can do the gating examples as a defined class into the ontology - branch action item</b>

<b>AI:Alan to write up an OBI import/mapping strategy doc as described at the workshop</b> 

<b>AI:AR/JM/MC will work through a use case with the cell type ontology import needed for biomaterial and test this strategy and report on the results. This will be an OBI application ontology as soon as we start bringing into OBI </b>

<b>AI:develop a strategy for dealing with the OBO foundry ontologies and OBI application ontology if import works</b>

<b>AI:Add imports and all related issues as an agenda item for the next workshop SS</b>


==Action Items Thursday==

<b>AI:
* Summary editor note in OWL file, can point to external URL if needed
* Summary should be in text use SVN change log note to say what has been changed as well. 
* Use <i>Editor Note</i> if becomes too complex in the OWL file these can be stripped out, next release will have 2 files, one with E. note one without
* Doesn't need to be done retrospectively
* This relies on a
  * usable and used deprecation policy
  * A tracker will be used instead of email for tracking issues, this will be SF until a decision is made
  * We will look at new tracker options due to SF issues, will be added to a future developers call, options trac, w3c, sf. A wiki vote page will be set up by JM
  * If something comes to dev-list, it can be referred to a branch instead
  * When proposing an item in tracker we will discuss on dev call, assign a date for closure, it will be assigned to a person, and that person will take responsibility for resolving discussion and closing on the due date decided.
  * If you have tracker things from this meeting (look for your initials) use the tracker
</b>

<b>AI:Two proposals for release notes, OWL file annotation property and SVN checkin logs</b>

<b>AI:</b>


<b>AI:AR will look into what are committing to in becoming a W3C group</b>

    * we need to have three W3C supporters
    * get telecon
    * get webspace
    * use of tracker
    * need an editor
    * benefit for community


<b>AI:Have a vote to remove people from coordinators list if they are not participating in OBI. Will contact everyone to ask for a replacement/withdraw. CS</b>

<b>AI:Identify what the responsibilities are for a coordinator and a community representative - Coord Call. CS</b>

<b>AI:Things get voted on in wiki by proposing a vote on a dev call</b>

<b>AI:if consensus cannot be reached by developers, coordinating will decide by some as yet undefined mechanism</b>

<b>AI:Deprecation policy will be discussed on next coordinators call to allow others to comments. AR Proposal for discussion is that we use OBO foundry process, add an obsolete class. Issues with logical definitions and previous use of editor note for this CS</b>

<b>AI:Paper proposal on engineering methodology to provide an incentive</b>

<b>AI:custom google custom search box for OBI wiki will be requested from CS group CS</b>

<b>Someone needs to put all the notes into the WIKI and make sure that they are all findable JM</b>

<b>AI:DENRI, Relations, Quality, Role need links to their term list files and or notes on the Branch Conf Calls</b>

<b>When call minutes done, sent to list for branch or dev, coord, and name minutes from that date and that branch - All branch editor and or person hosting dev or coord call</b>

<b>AI:Multi branch issues will go tracker and hence a dev call</b>

<b>AI:General feeling that there is no design whereby computing over h'archy depth is designed into OBI and it's not a good way to work with OBI at present MC will speak to EM about this</b>

<b>AI:An underscore will be added to each branches helper classes, each branch will deal with this themselves</b>

<b>AI:MC will add stimulus to the tracker</b>


<b>AI:Bioportal should point at the most recent version OBI-OWL merged file release so that progress is visible. We could release every 2 weeks, point at what changes in change log. Could be pull or push. CS</b>

<b>Bi-weekly releases of the OBI merged file will be made in SVN, it will be versioned . This will require unit tests from Bill (another AI from this workshop), will be in OWL-DL, likely this will mean use of pellet. Will be released on 1 and 15 of each Month. First release will be on March 1. For release it must classify in pellet at a minimum. This will be a per 1.0 release. JG will provide his an xls version as well BB, MC, CK, JG</b>

<b>Coordinators/Core Dev will review March 1 release and add to track for resolution</b>

<b>BB/MC will report of the resolution of the curation complete issues discussed elsewhere - DONE</b>

<b>AI:Coordinators/Core Dev will review March 1 release and add to track for resolution, will be added by Mar 15</b>

<b>AI:we need the criteria that define what is the prioritization for issues and if nec. we take it to a vote for e.g.  Mar 1 release, depends on CS mail to coordinators. SS will mail CS so that we can make the time line work. </b>

AI:BP and AR will try and develop ProtocolApplication from Plan to evaluate whether this can be done automatically

AI:Protocol and ProtocolApplication branches will be merged. The OWL files for Plan, Protocol have been merged by AR. He will send instructions to the dev list

AI:Produce an example a Protocol acquired into ProtocolApplication from ArrayExpress - HP

AI:RS will provide a clinical trial example of protocol

AI:HP will produce an example from ArrayExpress Protocol->ProtocolApplication

AI:How do we embed OBI in different systems - AR wants as focus of a session this week

AI:Alan will generate a list of problems and solutions with DENRI for discussion on a conference call

AI:BS will provide a better name for MeasurementUnit as Units pre-exist in the world outside data and so the name is bad.

AI:BS will provide an example of function/role that doesn't involve doubling up with role and functions

AI:Organization needs a place in the ontology, not yet determined

AI:JW will provide a link for PDBs effort to do this for beamlines

AI:Make the connection between the visulation here between table and graph that comes out of this process currently that is in the DENRI branch

AI: DT branch will consider using objective, not role for e.g. normalization - might make things easier and practical consequences will not be huge: DT branch, Protocol

AI:Role is confusing and all the discussions will be distilled by BS and AR for clarity

AI:BS will devolve organization ontology, document ontology and information entity to a new ontology in the future, these are too high level for OBI

AI:BB will send the link to his modified BirnLex SW ontology to the data transformation branch

AI:AR will post the OBO release policy document and people will offer comment on if this is a good policy for OBI
