Review of the latest ontology version in OBI.

Use cases - we haven't been able to meet all of a complex use case and so we have broken this down into smaller cases. Want to use one of Ted's and one of Ricardo's use cases to look at the bigger picture and broke down the use cases.

RP:The way that we do things in my group is very standardized, may be a good surprise for OBI

RP:Looks like cells etc are really well represented, what about patients?

JM:We use roles for that, and population for community

PRS:population is what you mean by community? We have ways to describe the recruit process etc

RP:Idea of people and their biomaterials is interesting

PRS:Is a consequence of BFO and the way it models these

Use cases:

Data annotation
Smart forms - autocompletion
QC - nonsense detection - annotation detected etc
