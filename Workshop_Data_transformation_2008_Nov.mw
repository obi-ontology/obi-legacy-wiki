Action Items Day 1:

AI:Hammer BFO/IO for answers on where variables will be in the ontology. Add this to the agenda for Vancouver. MC

AI:Need to add the fuzzy clustering methods - http://home.dei.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/cmeans.html RB added term proposal to tracker

AI:'center calculation' and 'averaging data transformation' defined classes need attention. MM thinks that these could be conflated. Moving average needs to be under both. Data imputation possibly incorrect - could be a class in itself. Need a new defined class for that - probably objective. - MM

AI:We will ask the metagenomic community for a use case.  We will work on this when we have use cases for these. PRS

AI: Sequence analysis becomes and objective, anything underneath will have it as an objective. Objective is 'sequence feature identification' or 'prediction' JM

AI:Find out what WAS classified under polynomial transformation (in some previous version) - need to have a property that is associated with it somehow. JM

AI:Send an email to RS about Network analysis objectives - ie what these are MC/RS

AI:Add a synonym to Network analysis - network topology analysis. - JM

AI:Need some way to relate multiple testing with the need for multiple test correction RB has a use case. RB

AI:Add more children for specific methods of multiple testing procedure. - MM

AI:We need a new objective - 'Type 1 Error Rate correction' - JM

AI:JM will email Elisabetta offline to ask about MA transformation objective. JM

AI:MM will look to see whether other scaling adjustments are used instead of loess ever. MM

AI:Loess scale group transformation is a scaling adjustment. CHange tree to reflect this. Just the scaling, not the transformation. Add a scaling objective will be added, loess scale gp trans is-a loess group transformation, followed by a scaling adjustment. This will be a defined class - any dt with objective scaling. JM

AI:Add feature selection - objective. In this sense doing machine learning as in wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection - RB. Random forests should be under feature selection. RB

AI:MM will ask a colleague what to do for 3D and 2D feature extraction and if they are different. MM

AI: Feature extraction suggested to be made an objective also suggested in branch review. JM

AI:EH transformation - belongs where B transformation is sibling - B/H/EH/S transformations should have objective normalization JM

AI:Discriminant analysis should be a synonym of classification or class discovery MM

AI:Differential expression analysis becomes an objective - as any test can be used - this is the objective not a test JM

AI:Review branch to check for missing subsumption of terms for objectives - ALL on branch call

AI:Add CART random forest to OBI MM will define , QT clustering - RB will define

AI:Need definition for Ward's method under agglomerative h'arch clustering - MC

AI:Descriptive stats also becomes an objective - JM

AI:Def trimmed mean calc - has part trimming process, suceeded by mean calculation. Outlier removal to be added as an objective. - MM

AI:add variable into the DT or DENRIE hierarchy - see how we have done it, and then it will get done. - MC/JM

AI:create a sheet for variables as these determine what test you do - ALL workshop

AI:Address dimensionality reduction vs. data vector reduction - if these are the same thing - then we can have a single term for both. - MC will also add this to the email.


AI:gating is not a dimensionality reduction and is therefore incorrectly placed under property based vector reduction - PBVR. Gating has objective data partioning, goes under the root. PBVR - was this created so that gating will fall into the hierarchy? Needs checking with RS - MC. will Send an email Richard to describe the issue and see if he is happy with the proposed changes in gating - MC

AI:Background correction - changes to an objective. RB

AI:Change 'data partitioning' to an objective - JM

AI:Find information for B transformation (existing term) - need an objective. - RB added note to tracker

AI:Send the variables docs (see link top of page) to IO, Plan, dt for discussion. -MC will be added to the agenda for the dev call 18 Nov 2008 - MC
