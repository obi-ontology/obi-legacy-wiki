Review of the latest ontology version in OBI.

Use cases - we haven't been able to meet all of a complex use case and so we have broken this down into smaller cases. Want to use one of Ted's and one of Ricardo's use cases to look at the bigger picture and broke down the use cases.

RP:The way that we do things in my group is very standardized, may be a good surprise for OBI

RP:Looks like cells etc are really well represented, what about patients?

JM:We use roles for that, and population for community

PRS:population is what you mean by community? We have ways to describe the recruit process etc

RP:Idea of people and their biomaterials is interesting

PRS:Is a consequence of BFO and the way it models these

Use cases:

Data annotation
Smart forms - autocompletion
QC - nonsense detection - annotation detected etc
Data exchange

JM:Do these fit with your needs RP?

RP:Research divided into basic, T1 clinical, T2 community. We deal a lot with clinical - about propsective studies, how do you formulate a research question. Literature, question, data analysis, from there, into the final manuscript. Very modular. We do data annotation towards the research question, and exclusion/inclusion criteria. QC not applies that much. Data exchange - huge thing in clinical research. What do you mean by that?

JM: Vocabularies, formats etc - all of these. Query across all knowledge bases

RP:CDISC example - protocols for data exchange and the vocabulary are distinct for them

JM:That undersells OBI a bit

RP:variable structure - ordinal, and role - what is the role - outcome, potential confounder - that's exchange. Vocab is about how we state gender.  That's what I mean

JM:If you look at data annotation - that's vocab. Not using more than that. But we can use it as part of a knowledge base and then we have a way to do more than simply use the vocabulary

RP:We have qm within the variable descriptions. Exchange is more interesting than the vocab. We are translating SNOMED into portugese. Not a nice process.

JM:Design decisions - we decided to use some devices to progress. We wanted to use roles to say that a transformation plays a role to avoid multiple parentage. Processes can't be the bearer of roles, this caused a problem for the design. Therefore we had an 'objective' - e.g. clustering, classifying.

MC:we had a hierachy originally with these terms in built e.g. normalization and this had a lot of parentage issues. 

JM:We are using the reasoner to build the hierarchy we have - we avoid multiple inheritance, also more maintainable.

JM:Input and output - dt has 'non realizable info entity' - these terms may not live in OBI for ever. We may import these in future.

RP:Ontolology is on SVN?

JM/PRS:Yes and is all DL. 

JM:The complexity of describing input/outputs allows use to futureproof things. We need to say some things about some dts. E.g. Log base 10 - we no way to represent this in OBI. Due to things being unclear with BFO. Some transformations have a feature e.g. log - allows capture difference between log base 10 and log base 2. Shouldn't be here in the long term. 

HP:Is under data transformation, not really there

MC:For convenience we could assert it under OWL thing for now

JM:Will not stay there for sure. We have not reached a satisfactory conclusion. BS thinks that numbers should be under a number ontology. Better live in the information ontology.

RP:Is OBI operational? Will show some applications where this will be implemented

MC:We have systems for maintaining stability, ids, etc, and meaning not just labels. We guarantee to you that the ids stay the same. 

RP:But position may change?

MC:If log base moves, we need to decide if changes the meaning. We then deprecate and change.
