'''Case Study 0001'''

We wish to annotate an experiment performed as part of an investigation in which the effects of a particular amino acid substitution in the PB1-F2 protein of influenza virus is being evaluated. Although the investigators consider the experiment in question to be one experiment, several discrete steps of sample processing, assaying and data analysis are involved as listed below.  We would like to annotate the experiment in such a way as to allow the ability to recognize other experiments that use some of the same sub-process steps.

This case study was submitted by Richard Scheuermann, Jan 2008 and the full description of the case study can be found [[Case_study_0001| here]].

Specific Evaluation for Data Processing

1. I have conducted an expression microarray experiment involving two conditions with replicate assays per condition, where I have both biological and technical replicates. I’m running two kinds of differential expression analyses: 
(a) one at the gene level and 
(b) one at the gene set level. 
In (a) my aim is to identify differential expressed genes (e.g. via algorithms like PaGE and SAM). In (b) my aim is to identify, from an a priori given collection of gene sets (e.g. user provided, or based upon GO annotation), which of these sets are differentially expressed as a whole (e.g. via algorithms like GSEA or SAM-GSA). Before running the analyses I’m preprocessing the data with the following data transformation series: (i) filter out flagged reporters, (ii) normalize the individual assays, (iii) average across technical replicates (but not across biological replicates). I need to annotate all steps above.

2. I have conducted an experiment involving multiple phases, both experimental and computational: 
a. A gene expression experiment where I have profiled gene expression in human across multiple conditions.
b. An analysis where I first cluster the genes using the data from (a) and then I perform sequence analysis on the promoter regions of genes in the same cluster to find common motifs. The latter is accomplished both by focusing on conserved regions (after alignment of my sequences to mouse sequences) in these promoters, and then by the application of motif finder algorithms (e.g. MEME or PWM-based). Through this I identify a collection of candidate binding sites for a set of transcription factors.
c. I compare the candidates I found in (b) to results from separate ChIP-chip experiments involving those same transcription factors and samples.
I need to annotate all the above. This includes all pre-processing performed on the expression and ChIP-chip data and all the analyses carried out: clustering, identification of promoter regions, alignment, motif finding, identification of bound reporters in the ChIP-chip experiment, etc.

3. I have conducted an experiment involving miRNA expression arrays, mRNA expression arrays and proteomics. After pre-processing each dataset, I relate differentially expressed miRNAs to their computationally predicted targets (using a pre-defined prediction algorithm). Then I verify whether such targets are differentially expressed (inversely to the miRNAs) in either the mRNA or the proteomics experiment to confirm targets and also the action of the miRNA on them (mRNA degradation vs translation repression).
I need to annotate all pre-processing in the three dataset, all differential expression analyses and the target prediction analysis.

Data Exchange

1. I have completed a flow cytometry experiment that I wish to annotate and provide to a collaborator along with the primary data for analysis. We have agreed to use RDF to describe instrumentation details and I will use OBI to provide the terms. We will exchange a data bundle which has both the raw data, RDF metadata describing instrumentations, XML metadata describing other experimental details and an RDF index file. Software tools will be able to parse the various component files and be able to access the instrumentation information as part of the analysis procedure.

2. We will submit the experimental datafile bundle to a data repository, which will parse the instrumentation RDF file so included details can be searched for by third parties.

'''From Melanie Courtot 27th November 2007'''

(note: I am trying to summarize the work done during a previous project - let me know if you need more details)

I am working in a network of wet labs. We are all together trying to over express and purify, then crystallize membrane proteins of interest.
I want to annotate every step of the project, from cDNA collection to structure resolution: cDNA collection, cloning, subcloning,expression assays in different systems (yeast, viruses...), expression results analysis (dot blots, western blots, biacore assays...) , solubilisation and purification trials/results, refolding assays if necessary, then crystallization trials and structures solved (different technics, NMR, x-ray diffraction...). + in some cases structure prediction after target selection.

I want to:
*  prepare a list of annotated targets of interest
*  store these results using a LIMS
*  be able to export them (share them with an other lab), with enough information for somebody else to reproduce the experiment
*  be able to track back the previous step(s) of an experiment
*  be able to compare the different protocols/systems

I also might want to:
*  compare/align sequences (DNA or proteins)
*  search for certain patterns in these sequences (hydrophylic/phobic residues...)
*  apply certains calculations to my sequences (eg calcul of the fusion point)

'''From James Malone Dec 2007'''

We wish to annotate microarray data using OBI which consists of three benchmark datasets: Leukemia cancer dataset, Colon cancer dataset and Lymphoma cancer data set. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, Euclidean distance, cosine coefficient, information gain, mutual information and signal to noise ratio have been used for feature selection. Multi-layer perceptron, k-nearest neighbour, support vectormachine and structure adaptive self-organizing map have been used for classification.

'''From Susanna Sansone/Philippe Rocca-Serra/Daniel Schober Jan 2008'''

We are developing a system archive to store 1) metadata descriptors for studies with assays employing transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics (omics) technologies and 2) their associated data files. We will have a) a tool for entering/describing the study and assay metadata, plus submit the associated data files, and b) an interface for querying the studies and their assays - using the metadata descriptors only- and downloading the data files.  See BioMAP at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/net-project/

There are key metadata descriptors for which we need CVs/ontologies, e.g.
* type protocols
* type of instruments and their parameters
* data processing methods
* study design
* sample characteristics (e.g. organism name, organ part)
* factors, or variables of the study (virtually these can be everything, in most of our use cases are compound/drug, dose related)
* measuraments or endpoints measured (e.g. gene expression, protein identification): these are relate to the one below
* technology types (e.g. DNA microarray, Mass Spectrometry): these need to be related to the one above
* data file type

These same metadata descriptors will be provided to the users to browse and query the content our system.

1. I want to perform a systematic review of the clinical data in OBI that prospectively compared mechanical bowel preparation with no mechanical bowel preparation for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgical resection. I would search using the following search terms: (1) “Surgical Procedures, Elective” AND “Colorectal Surgery”  AND mechanical bowel preparation; (2) mechanical bowel preparation AND elective AND surgery; (3) mechanical bowel preparation AND surgery AND colon AND rectum. I am interested in studies that have two groups (one with mechanical bowel preparation and one without mechanical bowel preparation) and have the two outcomes of interest, anastomotic leaks and wound infections. Meta-analysis will be performed on the data using Peto-Odds ratio (fixed effects model). 

2. I have completed an analysis assessing alcohol use patient who have undergone bastric bypass surgery in the past 5 years and I want to annotate  this experiment using OBI. Each patient is sent a medical questionnaire to assess changes in their alcohol consumption, tolerance, and abuse since the time of their operation. Total pre and post alcohol consumption and unadjusted alcohol consumption was compared and trends were analyzed. Data will be reported with odds-ratios.

Structural Biology Scenarios:

Here is a narrative description of a structural biology investigation:

An experimental objective is to determine the atomic-level 3D-structure of a
target protein which will be used to establish the protein function.  Two
experimental approaches are attemped: X-ray crystallography and NMR.  The 
structure result of the investigation is later used to model a component
in a larger structural investigation. 

A preliminary NMR HSQC experiment provides evidence of a folded protein.   
A 3D NOESY-[1H,15N,1H]-ZQ-TROSY NMR experiment is performed on isotopically
labeled sample of the target protein.  An ensemble of the 30 structural
instances is derived from this experiment.  One member of this set is chosen as
the representative based on a minimum energy refinenement criterion.  

The selenomethione-labeled protein was expressed, purified and crystallized in
the manner described for the native target protein.  The crystal specimen is 
obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion experiment consisting of soluble
protein and buffer components. Diffraction data is collected at SSRL on Beamline
BL9-1 on the cryogenically frozen protein crystal.  The 3D X-ray structure of
the protein crystal is subsequently determined using MAD phasing followed by TLS
refinement.  Analysis and validation of the resulting structure model reveals two 
regions of low stereochemical quality and the structure is subsequently refit to 
address this.   The final model exhibits a novel structural fold.  The protein
interactions observed in the putative multi-meric structure provides supporting 
evidence of the biochemical function of the protein.    

A subsequent 3DEM experiment uses this X-ray structure as a molecular replacement
model in a structural study of viral protein assembly ... 
 

Use case examples related to this example:

The narrative presents the context that a user would like to appreciate about 
a structural investigation.  In fact the parts of this experiment may come from 
the work of many different investigators working asynchronously.  Linking the 
component experiments must be performed based on protein sequence and deposition
time.  

Protein sequence is a fundamental information entity in the PDB data processing
pipeline.  Resolving the mapping of the experimentally observed structure onto 
the protein sequence is a key task in the annoation process. Linking to biological 
annotation is performed largely via sequence database accession or via protein 
sequence.  Similarly, the sequence is an important entry point to finding PDB
data. 

For small molecule components of structural experiments, chemical identity and 
nomemclature is standardized relative to a project dictionary of chemical descriptions.  
This reference file includes: molecular names and synonyms; conventional atom names; 
covalent bonding and stereochemical assignments; model and ideal 3D coordinates;
and descriptors such as InChI and SMILES.  

In a PDB dataset, each step in the above narrative procedure may be accompanied by 
additional experimental details. As with any resource, the PDB data model provides
placeholders for the maximum level of detail to capture this information.  However,
the coverage of these details is uneven and the focus here will be on those
details that are likely query targets.   

Here are 3 examples which are typical of the experimental detail we would like to represent.
There are many common features in these examples such as:  physical measures such
as length & temperature; dates and intervals; instruments used and their operating conditions;
solution preparation & concentration measures;  software applications used; and
numerical details characterizing the results.   

Example 1. Protein Production -  

The following example for protein expression is typical of the protocol level detail
collected by PepcDB (http://pepcdb.rcsb.org/ for PSI Structural Genomics targets.   
Protocols are collected for target selection, cloning, expression, purification, 
crystallization, NMR screening.  We are beginning to classify/mine these protocols
for common methodologies/treatments, instrumentation,  named substances and biological materials.

Competencies related to the structural biology examples - 

#Standardization: Our data processing and annotation pipeline needs to recogonize and annotate common/standard experimental details.  Similarly, these need to be provided as query targets in our search services.
#Validation:  Automatically identify improbable or incompatible experimental conditions.  
#Traversal: Starting from the specification of a protein sequence/name create an ordered summary of the available experimental results (similar to the narrative description).
#Mining: Select those structures annotated to participate in a particular biological process (GO:xxxx) and constrained by some experimental condition(s).
#Integration: For all protein structures lacking an assignment of biochemical function, find results from other biomedical investigations that may contribute to an assignment.  Similarly, present semantic entry points to the available structure data making this data interpretable in other biomedical investigations.

'''From Richard Scheuermann, Jan 2008'''

1. OBI should support a description of assay types in which the relationships between assay types based on similarities in input types and output types are captured.

2. OBI should support the assignment of specific roles to all of the objects involved in investigations and how the role of an object may change with time or context.

3. OBI should provide a mechanism for describing all aspects of a biomedical investigation, including study design, specimen processing, laboratory measurements and data analysis, and how each of the objects and processes relate to each other through a logical framework.

====Hypothesis====

Asprin can reduce swelling in an injured limb in mice

====Experimental Approach====
# Induce swelling in limbs of mice
# Half of the mice receive asprin, half do not
# Measure the reduction in swelling in both groups over 24 hours
# If a statistically significant number of mice reduce swelling more quickly than mice treated with a placebo, then asprin has the ability to reduce swelling
# If there are differences in the response to asprin, then we examine tissues to try and identify the causes of the differences.
 
====Experimental Protocols====

=====Protocol 1 - Selection and housing of mice=====
# Select 50 male and 50 female mice of a given strain
# Have a standard housing protocol for all the mice. Acclimatize them for two days
# After two days, 48 male and 50 mice were determined to be healthy and could be used in protocol 2. The other mice died during acclimatization
 
=====Protocol 2 - Induction of injury=====
# Measure the volume of the left front foreleg of each mouse.
# Use an apparatus to immobilize and hit the front foreleg of each mouse with a defined amount of force.
# Allow each mouse to recover for 4 hours
# Measure the amount of swelling by increased volume
# Mice with a greater than 10% increase in volume are used for the study
 
=====Protocol 3 - Preparing asprin and placebo doses.=====
# Prepare a 100 microgram/ml solution of asprin
# Quantitate the asprin concentration by spectrophotometry
# Prepare a 100 microgram/ml solution of CaCl
# Quantitate the CaCl concentration by spectrophotometry
 
=====Protocol 4 - Administration of Asprin=====
# Divide the male and female mice up into four equally sized groups.
# Take one group of  each sex and inject each animal with 1 ml of asprin solution. Record the time of injection.
# Measure and record the volume of the limb for each asprin injected mouse at two hour intervals.
# Take the second group of each sex and inject each animal with the CaCl placebo solution. Record the time of injection.
# Measure and record the volume of the limb for each CaCl injected mouse at two hourly intervals.
# Continue all measurements for a 48 hour period.
 
=====Protocol 5 - Analysis of Data=====
# For each animal subtract the volume of the limb before treatment from the volume of the limb after treatment for each animal at each measured time period.
# For each group for each time period, work out the mean value of the difference in volume and the standard deviation of the measurements.
 
=====Protocol 6 - Analysis of organs=====
# Each animal was sacrificed by cervical dislocation after the last measurement.
# The following organs were harvested and weighed for each animal: Brain, heart, lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, left and right foreleg muscles
# Sections of each organ were prepared for histological examination by using the paraffin embedded mounting procedure.
# All remaining tissues and the prepared slides were stored at -20C prior to analysis
 
====Results====
# CaCl2 treated animals continued to show increased swelling for 12 hours after administering the CaCl2 solution. Asprin treated animals showed increased swelling for only  2 hours after administration of the asprin solution
# After 24 hours post injection, 75% of the asprin treated animals' limbs has returned to their original sizes. Only 65% of CaCl2 treated animals limbs' had returned to their original size by the end of the study.
# The weights of all organs, except for swollen muscle limbs showed no significant differences in weight. The muscles crushed muscles showed increased weight compared to the uninjured muscles.
# We examined the tissue sections of affected and unaffected limbs animals that showed swelling at the end of the study. Sections were stained to show nuclei and cell boundaries. Muscle fibers from injured limbs had increased size compared to uninjured controls. Injured limbs had increased macrocyte infiltration. However asprin treatment reduced both muscle size and the degree of muscular swelling seen in sections.
 
====Conclusions====
# Asprin reduces muscular swelling post injury. CaCl2 was seen to have little or no affect
# Some animals show lower levels of responsiveness to the administration of asprin.
# In tissue sections, the administration of asprin has the effect of reducing muscular swelling due to injury and reducing macrocyte infiltration as a response to injury
# We conclude animals that had asprin and which responded better to the treatment by reducing swelling faster have a gene mutation that allows them to respond faster. Animals that do not respond as quickly lack this mutation. We are investigating this further.


==Informal Compentency Questions==

'''Informal Competency Questions''': the requirements of the ontology, dependent on the [[Motivation]]. Described as informal questions or tasks that an ontology must be able to answer. The Gomez-Perez book on Ontological Engineering (http://books.google.com/books?id=UjS0N1W7GSEC) describes competency questions as (pp 119-120, when describing the methodology to create the TOVE ontologies): "..a set of natural language questions, called competency questions, are used to determine the scope of the ontology. These questions and their answers are both used to extract the main concepts and their properties, relations, and formal axioms of the ontology...Given the set of informal scenarios, a set of informal competency questions are identified. Informal competency questions are those written in natural language to be answered by the ontology once the ontology is expressed in a formal language. The competency questions play the role of a type of requirement specification against which the ontology can be evaluated."

*Note: the original compentency question page can be found [[https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/EvaluationPhase1Submissions here]]. The details of which need to be reworked and merged within this page

=== Informal Competency Questions for the PSI Gel Working group ===
According to the [http://psidev.info/index.php?q=node/91 MIAPE GE] guidelines, OBI would be required to hold terms specific to the methods and techniques of protein separation using gel electrophoresis and cover gel manufacture and preparation, running conditions, protein detection techniques, the method of image acquisition and a technical description of the digitised image generated. Therefore, the competency questions are:
# Does OBI have all the terms that are represented in [http://psidev.sourceforge.net/gps/CV/ sepCV]?

The competency questions specific for sepCV are: 

* Does sepCV support the minimal information reporting guidelines of MIAPE GE?
* Does sepCV explicitly model the terms required by the use-cases modelled using [http://psidev.info/index.php?q=node/83#formats GelML]?
* Are the concepts an accurate representation and a reflection of the terms used in the application domain of Sample processing and separation techniques?
* Are the definition and semantic meaning of terms unambiguous within the context of the application domain of sample processing and separation techniques?
* Is sepCV a community defined and accepted lexicon for a sample processing and separation techniques?

=== Informal Competency Questions as a result of discussions on obi-instrument branch ===

[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=90B06673D826C64E8ED8EEA6B6FDF8CA02190082%40crcmail1.BCCRC.CA&forum_name=obi-instrument-branch Archived Email thread]
These represent more discussion points rather than specific questions

The requirements of those acting as OBI-complient data producers are different from the requirements of
OBI-complient data consumers. 
# Producers need to have guidlines, the framework and support in providing their data. 
# Consumers need the framework, available data and tools to support a wide range of querying, including fairly ad-hoc queries. 
# Do we need to distinguish between 'browsing' consumers where all the work is done by a person clicking on links, and 'systematic' consumers where the heavy-lifting is done by software agents?

=== [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=0BF025DD64B01342A4F6552D5E452F0C018AF797%40FRD01EXCMBX01.ads.invitrogen.net&forum_name=obi-devel Archived email Thread] - Regarding commercial terms within OBI ===

#The company has the option to maintain the OBI-view of their catalogue

#OBI should provide clear guide-lines for how a company could represent their catalogue with OBI

#Presenting catalogues using OBI should not impact in any way the ability of the company to represent, present or distribute the catalogue in alternative formats

#The presence of a company-maintained catalogue does not impact upon the possibility of some other party (OBI or a third-party) maintaining information about some or all of the products listed in the catalogue in some other OBI-complient source. It is, however, desirable that where practical, a single product is described in a single place.

And there is a responsibility that the company has:


#The company has a responsibility to make it clear what the licensing terms are for any OBI-formatted catalogue information, so that recipients know if they can refer to or replicate in part or in full the information contained within the catalogue.


#OBI must enable annotation tools (OBI editors, or less specialized apps) to use a wide range of relevant OBI-complaint terms. Regardless of the underlying engineering or technical details, the user must have the option of being presented with a single, integrated view of the domain.
