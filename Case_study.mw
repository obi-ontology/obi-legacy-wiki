A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study case study] is a description of a scenario that you would like OBI to represent. For example the description of a particular scientific experiment. A case study can be a textual description or represented more formally. The following is a list of case studies that have been submitted for representation within OBI. A case study is not the same as a [[Use_case| use case]]. A use case shows how OBI can be used for a particular application. Each case study has its own page.
