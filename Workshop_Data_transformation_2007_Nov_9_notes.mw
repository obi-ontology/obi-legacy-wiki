Data Transformation Workshop, Cambridge

Friday 9th November 2007 Notes

Present: JM, EM, MC, PR, HP

[[Data_transformation_workshop| Main Data Transformation Workshop page>> ]]

Discussion on the classification hierarchy, with supervised and unsupervised learning as children of classification_method.

EM: There are examples in which techniques can be used as either supervised or unsupervised

JM: Could perhaps use these as roles

General agreement that we may need either multiple inheritance or roles because of above issue

Discussion with Phillipe about Plan branch: 

AI: MC and JM to help load list of terms and hierarchy for algorithm into plan branch (Note in owl file algorithm is not currently under plan - needs moving).  Also need to add definition for algorithm.
