Friday 9th November 2007 Notes

Present: JM, EM, MC, PR, HP

Discussion on the classification hierarchy, with supervised and unsupervised learning as children of classification_method.

EM: There are examples in which techniques can be used as either supervised or unsupervised

JM: Could perhaps use these as roles

General agreement that we may need either multiple inheritance or roles because of above issue
