Discussion on the classification hierarchy, with supervised and unsupervised learning as children of classification_method.

EM: There are examples in which techniques can be used as either supervised or unsupervised

JM: Could perhaps use these as roles

MC: We may need either multiple inheritance or roles because of above issue

JM: Supervised and unsupervised classification should be disjoint concepts; a concept can be one or the other but not both. 

General Agreement that we will use classification, supervised and unsupervised as roles.

MC: We may need to add restrictions to some of these since some concepts should only be one or other

EM: We also need to add phylogenetic analysis as role or a concept somewhere

AI: Submit classification as role and supervised_classification and unsupervised_classification as children of classification role to role branch.

EM: Classification is the union of supervised and unsupervised classification, however there are instances in which only one algorithm can use a role (restriction)

Discussion with Philippe about Plan branch: 

AI: MC and JM to help load list of terms and hierarchy for algorithm into plan branch (Note in owl file algorithm is not currently under plan - needs moving).  Also need to add definition for algorithm.

MC: Algorithm is a plan because it has the potential to be executed (as a plan)
