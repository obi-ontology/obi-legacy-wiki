Reducing the OBI consortium membership to active ones post-publication.
The process will be started after submission of the publication. For now, we can start with brainstorming on the wiki. There will need to be a vote on the proposed process.

Discussion items during the July 8, 2009 Coordinators call:

Alan Ruttenberg: If we are to vote, we need a trimmed list so people know what they are voting for (at least if it goes outside this meeting)
James Malone: i would suggest we have a complete re-apply for OBI
Chris Stoeckert: can ask people what their commitment will entail
James Malone: turn up for calls, be willing to host dev call, be willing to accept action items, if you don't do these things then you are revmoed
Melanie Courtot: what about "good standing system" from w3c?
Alan Ruttenberg: summary: advisory board means you must respond to explicit queries, say 2 out of 3 times.
