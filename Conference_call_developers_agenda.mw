'''25 June"  Chair: Oliver

Attendees: Chris, Philippe, Alan, Christian, Jie, James, Carlo, Oliver (Chair) 

Representation of 'predicted data' and 'measured data'
- We have 'measurement datum' in IAO/OBI now. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000109
- We also have 'predicted data item': http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0302867
- Jie: We have 'data item' in CORE but not measurement datum

Philippe: 
- measurement unit label is different from a measurement unit in the same way a product label is not a product
- We don't have measurement unit. We have measurement unit label. 
- 'mass unit' is imported from unit ontology and inserted under 'measurement unit label'. This is a problem. A unit and a unit label are not the same. 
- what units are?
- the issue i raise is that scalar measurement always compare to a standard scale
- predicted data can be compared to measured data, out of some measurement assay.
- Christian: out of some computation, does not have to compare to measured data.

Alan:
- what does the predicted value 10.1 grams mean
1) need to say how "models" work
2) is_about points to a type rather than an instance

Christian raises the issue of a "real" measurement being associated with a model

Chris Stoeckert:
- but in OBI we can restrict  - no unicorns!
- We are restricting our models to things that are real.

Christian Boelling: 
- the definition of iao:data item should be reviewed in any case: the truthfulness part of it, that I find problematic and a source of confusion.
- Data items and truth: the current definition of data item states that an instance of iao:data item "…is an information content entity that is intended to be a truthful statement…" 
- In fact, a data item is *NOT* a statement (as the current definition suggests) and as such is neither true nor false. Rather, (representations of) data items are part of statements such as "mouse#1 - has weigth - 10 gram" expressed in some suitable language (e.g.: OWL) with the last bit being an instance of data item.  It is *this statement* which may be true or false; *not* the data item.
-- propose the data item issue also for the IAO informal session at ICBO
- Relevant posts:
http://groups.google.com/group/information-ontology/msg/efced0aab4397f0c
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29421507
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29453949

Alan Ruttenberg:
- keeping backwards compatible as we make the future changes
- Another interpretation: the statement is: it is the case that 10 grams is a quality measurement of <that quality of the material entity> That can be true or false
- those statements look like <data item> <subproperty of is about> <something>

OBI release: 
- May not be ready to have another release since no major improvements have been made compared to last version.
- Alan: not ready in terms of updated measurement data representation
- Consensus: may postpone this OBI release to after ICBO meeting

Oliver:
We need to reserve at least one or two meetings for OBI tutorial, to be held on July 22nd, 2012, Graz, Austria:

'''18 June''' Chair: Philippe

Attending: Carlo Torniai, Marcus Chibucos, Jie Zheng, Yu Lin, Oliver He, Alan Ruttenberg, Bjoern Peters, Randi Vita, Chris Stoeckert,

Minutes:
Overall goal: reorganize 'data item branch' to avoid redundant
declaration as currently experienced.

proposal create 3 defined classes:


predicted data item: is_specified_output_of some 'prediction data
transformation'

specified/planned/set data item: is_specified_output_of  some 'planning'

measured data item: is_specified_output_of  some "assay or measurement"

Issues:

i. class naming:

'value specification' has been suggested to be rename 'value
denotation', which was deemed more neutral. However, it is being
argued that the term is misused.

-denotation (verb) = process that takes label/name and finds what it
points to.(AR)
-denotation (Noun) is the target of what is pointed to.(AR)

for context:
denotation (noun):the literal or primary meaning of a word, in
contrast to the feelings or ideas that the word suggests.
[mass noun] the action of indicating or referring to something by
means of a word, symbol, etc..
Philosophy the object or concept to which a term refers, or the set of
objects of which a predicate is true.
http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/denotation

denote (verb): be a sign of, indicate
http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/denote


No resolution as both the use of 'specification' and 'denotation'
labels can be miscontrued.

"value specification/denotation" is just value + unit


ii. discussion on aboutness:

argument that predicted data item are about something different than
measured data item
(predicted water temperature would not be about water but a realizable
entity Alan Ruttenberg's view)
Are 'predicted water temperature' and 'measured water temperature"
'about' the same entity?
(important note: it is assumed that the predictions result from a
'realistic model about an entity' which delivers values, which, by
plan, should be compatible with reality).
->unresolved discussion:

points are made for thinking in terms of type versus instances to help
clarifying the proposal:

	predicted data (wouldbe)_about universal (universal/type level)
	measured data is_about a particular of the type (instance level)

AI: ->drill on this point over next call.


iii. discussion on comparison process associated with predicted data.

argument that predicted data item always need to be presented in the
context of a comparison to actual measurement data.
"prediction of temperature is about a realizable entity realized in a
process in which when the conditions of the simuation obtain and a
measurement of temperature is made, that temperature is compared to
the predicted value and is approximately (or data item weasel word)
correct "
Christian Bolling argues that the comparison is a different and
distinct step. (see his post)

''' 27 Feb''' Chair: Larissa

 Attended: BP, LS, Jie, James Overton, Philippe, Chris Stoeckert, Melissa,Trish Whetzel, Marcus, Carlo, Zvita, Matthew Brush, Jen Fostel,

 1. jie: A reprt from the subgroup meeting about phenotype assessment

AI: Jie - prepare and post a short report on the subgroup work.

Shortly report of RCN: Plant people are interested in modeling metadata using OBI framework. I am in contact for this. They are also thinking to collect experimental condition. OBI can help in providing terms in annotations. Currently, they really want us to help in "growth condition" (modeling and annotation).

Suggestion:  subgroups should post short reports about their work and the results for the OBI dev. Subgroups activities should be better recognized and acknowledged.

On the related issue: people are having difficulty using OBI, e.g. developing annotation forms, contributing terms, alignning their existing ontology with OBI, etc. We need to think about better tutorial, regular help line, assistance, etc.

 2. the Revision of the OBI organizational structure. 
The documents has been accepted by the majority (only 1 vote against). The document will beposted on-line.

There were worth considering comments on the document made.
AI: LS - incorporate suggestions to improve the document and send an updated version to BP in a week.

AI: ALL -assign yourself to the tasks:

''' 9 Jan''' Chair: Jie

  1. Transition to BFO2
  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl
  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro.owl

  We decided to transit to BFO2 which is close to be officially released soon.
  * import the whole bfo.owl (light version)
  * MIREOT relations defined in ro.owl if needed

The reason we cannot make the release out due to one relation "towards" used in defining "molecular concentration". It may take a while to be in BFO 2. The term "molecular concentration" is in PATO scope and Chris Mungall agreed that the term should be in PATO. The term is not used by any other OBI terms. So, we decided to deprecate the term now for making the current release out. We will import the term from PATO when it is available since we used the term in the manuscript.

AI for Jie: release and keep track on it by contact Alan and Chris.

  2. OBI organizational structure
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NWms5Zxo0BDWezIHO86Z4yh9qqjLCYdCgjwBzd2s-Xs/edit

  We went through documents and defined who are 'active developers'. Please give your comments on:

''' 23 May''' Chair: Philippe
 - Minutes
 - Present: Anita,Jessica,Melissa,Bjoern,Jie,Marcus,Matt,Philippe
 - Excused: Alan

 - 1. OBI manuscript: roadmap

         Comment by Jessica: possible lack of information for newcomer -> need for a tutorial
                o. Action Item: creation of a tutorial and use case -> documention to point as supplementary material
         
         Input from Anita (http://obi-ontology.org/page/Publications) and Marcus (recent presentation to the GO) updates                
               i.Action Item Anita to update table of projects using OBI for annotation purposes.

               ii. include statement about ECO consuming OBI (possibly in discussion section)
               Marcus to take lead on this and, when done, pass on to Bjoern.

               iii. Some level of redundancy between some of the example in Applications of OBI.
               ->possible need to fuse and relevant parties will be contacted as necessary.
 
               iv. Sanity check against latest OBI release 
               i.e. check that all classes/relations mentioned in the manuscript match strictly with class 
               definitions (textual and formal).
               Note: process is painfull so should be done only once, when manuscript has solidified. 	
	
 - 2. Class metadata:
	
		OBI seems happy with current metadata but would not oppose changes provided work and              interoperability with other resources is not disrupted.
	 	
 - 3. Discussion on Datum (follow Asiyah post about dose, thread with Alan)
	
	Bjoern restated the issue which can be decomposed as follows:
	
	There are different problems: 
	i. time problems (translating weeks / months etc.)
	ii.age problems (time from when) 
	iii. measurement datum vs. quality 
	iv. measurement datum vs. specification datum
	
	points i and ii seem to cover a need from Anita, Melissa, Jessica but it is noted that might be out of scope (point i) 
	
	The current layout is an attempt to create a solution which would cover datum resulting from a measuring process and those datum corresponding to recommandations,directives ( use a solution of 20x TBE) and would be generic enought to avoid duplication of hierarchy.
	
	all points require more work -> calls to be dedicated to this. 
	
	Question:
	Why is point 4 necessary since, in OBI, we assumed 'canonical realization' of protocol specification.
	
	Possible explanation: 
	The specification will state 20xTBE, the experiment relying on that solution will *not* test that the solution has the right titer (assumption is the manufacturer did its job and there is no decay of the solution).
	Therefore, these 2 type of data /information datum may justify distinguishing them.
	
	
 - 4. no time to discuss term submissions









''' 16 May''' Chair: Chris

Given we hope the release will be out by then, the next priority would be the paper, any polishing needed for a paper-specific release, and Melissa's been following up on the genotype work/discussion/terms from the workshop earlier this year to incorporate those. 

''' 9 May''' Chair: Jessica
- Release issues: 1) IAO and OBI coordinated releases: Jie to talk to Alan and get a decision on that in the next two days. It should be ok to release OBI with references to the October release of IAO but want to check. 2) There are still 8 uncurated terms, which will be noted in the Release notes. 3) There are 3 "meta-data complete" terms which are actually missing definitions; those will be fixed as they can be and noted in the Release notes otherwise.

- Aiming for a release on Friday, because no one can edit the obi.owl files and add new terms until that's done and it's holding things up for everyone.

- there will be another release for the paper.

- Manuscript: Philippe needs to incorporate his changes into the Applications of OBI.docx in the repository. Bjoern put a Manuscript 2011 document in the repository. To edit it, the consensus is to check the manuscript out, send an email to the list locking it, use track changes, re-check it back into SVN when done and send an email letting folks know, just like when working on the .owl files.

''' 2 May''' Chair: Anita

  PRO - changed IRI, OBO -> OWL and PRO -> PR (will double check and contact Protein ontology people if it is true, AI for Bjoern)
   
- Chromatography device / Chromatography instrument (decide to merge the terms, not for this release)

- other release related issues (fixed during the call)

''' 4 April''' Chair: Bjoern

- Definition format
  Definition of A which is a subclass of B
  1. a B in which ...
  2. A is a B in which ...
  3. is a B in which ...
     - should use option 1

- Use of 'only' or 'some'
  For example, 'protein complex' has_part 'protein'
   'protein complex' has_part some 'protein' or 'protein complex' has_part only 'protein'?
     - should use some (transitive issue)

Attending:  AR, CS, CT, JF, JZ
Topic:  age measurement datum

age measurement assay: An assay that measures the duration of temporal interval of a process that is part of the life of the bearer, where the initial time point of the measured process is close, in some sense, to the beginning of some transitional state of the bearer such as birth or when planted.

note: life of bearer doesn't imply organism

note: this assay measures time not developmental stage.  we recognize that development can take different time periods under different conditions such as media / temperature

note: note that we are currently defining subtypes of age measurement datum that specify when the age is relative to, e.g. planting, as we don't have adequate temporal predicates yet.

note:  age as a quality is dubious;; we plan to revisit

note:  stages in development are currently handled with controlled vocabulary, such as 2-somite stage

age measurement assay realizes some evaluant role and has_specified_output some 'age measurement datum'

age measurement datum is_specified_output of some age measurement assay and is_quality_measure_of some age


'''8 November''' Chair: Chris S
 - MO term submissions, review of services

'''1 November''' Chair: Carlo T.
 - services

Agenda and notes:
1) Update about OBI release
2) Follow-up on eagle-i services

Attendees:
Carlo Torniai
Bjoern Peters
Melissa Hendel
Jessica Turner
Jennifer Fostel

Notes:

We briefly discuss about the status of OBI release and it seems that we are at the final stage with Alan reviewing the 
latest files Jie posted.

Discussion about services:
- We discussed about aligning the current service classes (under planned process) in eagle-i to what is in OBI related to service provider/consumer role.
We all agreed that instead of proliferation of roles we would like to identify for each of the current classes of services in eagle-i ( which are aligned with what NIF has) a process (starting from what is in OBI) and then have services as defined/inferred [process provided as service]

AI: Melissa and Carlo will go through the service classes and OBI processes to assess if there is the need to add processes to
Then e can discuss in the next OBI call the best way to define services.

Jessica Turner we will presenting her Cognitive Process ontology in one of the call in November in order to asses what should go in OBI/ what to import form OBI.

Agenda:
 
1. Dirk's time and space use case http://obi-ontology.org/page/Use_case_Lauwereyns_et_al_2002

- relation 'precedes'used to relate the ordered processes

- time, such as 1.5 sec, 'is duration of' a process 

- issue: how to represent one process repeated many times
 
possible solution: there will be 10 instances of the same specification, have a counting process, count = 10, or process has frequence/rate = 10  
  
AI for PRS: contact Barry to check the status of rate/frequence relation that they are working on  

- need some spatial terms used to describe a stimulus location relative to a subject

2. Chris and Jie's knockout mouse model http://obi-ontology.org/page/Use_case_knockout_Mouse

'''May 24'''

Chair: Alan Ruttenberg

'''May 19'''

Chair: Carlo T.

Agenda:

(1) Brief update on the QTT for eagle-i and NIF devices

(2) Follow up on time representation: How to say that Process A occurred before Process B / repeat Process A / etc.


CT, JZ, JF were attending. 
For QTT device it would be nice if somebody can review the current owl in the SVN (Helen? Bjoern?) so that we can have feedback in the next call.
As for repetition of process the email thread on the dev list has been definitely useful for representing a repetition of a process.
We didn't make anyway any decision except to have the two agenda items discussed again in the next call.



'''May 17'''

Chair: Philippe Rocca-Serra
on call:  JT, CT, JF
questions raised:  how to say Process A occurred before Process B / repeat Process A / etc.

* status of Nat. Biotech paper
* release of OBI at BioPortal
* Coordination with other OBO ontologies: e.g., SO (for genotypes genomes, IDO (for host etc.)
* 2011 ICBO workshop - what would we like to do?

'''May 10'''

Chair: Jie Zheng

Present: JF, CT, OH, JZ, BP, LS, AR, CS, JT, MH, DD

(1) Carlo will give an update on the instrument pattern and branch being developed for Eagle-i

AI for CT: send device spreed sheet files to OBI

AI for CT and MH: provide at least textual definition for functions (The logical definition of functions are not required now.)

Devices and related functions will be reviewed and added into separate OWL file.

"Part of device" class was proposed to be added into OBI  in  previous dev call. The "has_part" relation can solve this issue. So, there is no necessary to add the term. 

(2) Discuss the reviewer comments on the accepted SIG paper (Oliver)

OH: first draft of final version and will address the reviewers issues in the discussion section

AR: address the provenance issue

(3) Progress on using Protege 4.1 (Alan)

Worked in Mac, need volunteer to test it in PC

AI for JZ and AR: test it on PC 

(4) Time and space issues (Dirk)

Discuss some use cases of using time


'''May 5 '''

Chair:Oliver He

Present: JZ, BP, MH, JM, JF, AR, CT, LS, YH 

(1) SO-related terms: We discussed different options to represent mouse gene knockout.  

AI: Jie is going to modify the figure by including some tentative relations. 

(2) OBI main manuscript update: the letter to Nature Biotechnology was finalized during the call. Bjoern is going to email out the letter soon. 

(3) host and host of immune response: the host role will go to IDO. The term 'host of immune response' may not be a good ontology term, since it is indeed an immune response of some organism that bears the host role.

Went through AI from Vancouver http://obi-ontology.org/page/Workshop_OBI_Vancouver_2010_Mar#Summary_of_Action_items_and_owners

'''April 26'''
Chair: JF
On the call: CT, JZ, JT, LS, JF, JM

JT: Scales update. working with AR on handedness.  also working on age, gender, diagnosis.
AI to bring diagnosis to dev call when ready for discussion

JZ:  acrylamide gel question; incorrect definition and differs from agarose gel in inferred hierarchy
change definition: a processed material resulting from the polymerization of acrylamide with TEMED in some buffer solution
add:
is_specified_output_of some polymerization
has_part acrylamide (or has grain acrylamide?)

also change definition of agarose gel to:
a processed material resulting from the polymerization of agarose after heating agarose suspended in some buffer solution

consider X part_of device Z
if X has a function then X is a device itself
X and Z can had same or differing functions
X does not inherit function of Z; Z does not inherit function from X
if X does not have function then it is not a device, but is still part_of a device
X can exist without Z; in some cases Z can function without X
consider adding defined class under processed material 'part of device' -> processed material and is_part_of some device

editing (thanks, JZ!):
plate holder used to classify under measurement device; changed function to position function
bead parent class is not considered to be device; some bead children could be
NMR probe should have measurement function; added post-call

deferring instrument to later call, once devices are all classifying properly
we suspect centra web version does not permit the person using it to be promoted to co-presenter or to share screen


'''April 21''' 
on the call:  HP, CT, CS, JZ, JF; chairing:  HP/JF
 
HP has previously checked material entity, processed material that should be devices
 
device = processed material with some function
using this function to move asserted device classes to sub-classes.  e.g. measurement device
 
analog-to-digital converting device -> signal conversion function also info processing function
Faraday cage -> isolation function
heating block, cooling device, hyb station -> temperature control function
light source -> light supply function
liquid handler -> transfer function
cell-culture incubator -> temperature control function and atmosphere control function
 
did not have sufficient info to add function to Brucker Sample Rail system 
 
platform was discussed previously and a decision made to deprecate it; CS will send an e-mail
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2935433&group_id=177891&atid=886178
 
electrically-powered device was added at workshop and may include everything; we decided to deprecate it; HP will send e-mail
 
we found under chromatography:
chromatography has chromatography column, chromatography device (frits, jackets), chromatography instrument (pump, detector)
why is column not a device?
 
There is the general issue: how to consider things that are part of an instrument or a device and have function by being a part. 
What is the general guideline here?
 
reagents are devices bearing reagent role



1. We reviewed the AI from the Vancouver workshop - see summary here

http://obi-ontology.org/page/Workshop_OBI_Vancouver_2010_Mar#Summary_of_Action_items_and_owners

2. We started to work through the tracker items rated 9. Edited items 
commented in wiki, file to be checked back in shortly

3. Work in progress

AI: need a function for all the devices which currently don't have 
logical defs - HP will do a quick pass and make sure what we have to 
date makes sense. CT will report later on Eagle-i progress with this 
pattern. Discussion on electrically powered device not being fine 
grained for use - everything can be maded electrical by hooking it up to 
a motor.

AI: JZ will start implementation page for groups using obi and email 
when she is done to deal with AI from Vancouver, suggestion to cross 
link to reviewer comments google doc

AI:JT and AR have been working offline on handedness assays and scales 
for measuring same check in IAO handedness and  comment tracker item

'''April 12'''

Chair: JF

Yongqun He,Jie Zheng, Carlo Torniai, Jennifer Fostel, Jessica Turner, Allen, Alan Rutenberg attending

In Oliver's use case we identified:

(A) Study Design specifies the independent variables (correspond to experimental factors)
In use case, these include strain, vaccine type, pathogen, age, etc.
This corresponds to experimental (textual) hypothesis "I think that age, pathogen, vaccine type, etc. will impact vaccine protection."

(B) The Study Design Execution includes:
(1) planned process - curation of literature
 in use case this means (a) identify corpus of papers, (b) read the papers and (c) collect data: quantification of qualities (e.g. age, strain) + measurements (e.g. CFU reduction)
(2) data transformation - discretization  (convert e.g. continuous ages into "young" and "old" categories)
(3) select a subset of experimental factors to test using statistical hypothesis test such as ANOVA, predictive model, etc.
		specify this subset in process
(4) receive p_values for each experimental factor tested as output from statistical test
(5) interpret to support / refute hypothesis

add data transformation "discretization process" to tracker
specified input = continuous data
specified output = categorical/nominal data
objective = convert continuous data to categorical / nominal data

we plan to add to agenda for next call

'''April 7'''

Chair: JF
Discussion of Oliver's vaccine use case, in particular the link between data from assay, data in a dataset and ANOVA.

ANOVA design: input is (measurement) data and grouping data, ANOVA test carries out statistical analysis, and produces results (possibly a data set of features; possibly a test of hypothesis (null or experimental))

The input data is the dependent variable, the grouping data are independent variable(s).

The ANOVA tests the null hypothesis, which is different from hypothesis in general; Larissa is writing a paper about hypothesis and will distribute once ready.
Larissa also points out ontoDM. ANOVA is one of DM methods in ontoDM. 

following the call YH and JF had additional discussion about the specific use case; see e-mail from JF 4/7/2010, notes from today's call.

** according to AR 'training' can be included, but training as a service should not because there are trainings that are not services; on the same token 'DNA sequencing' and 'providing access' should be added as processes, not as services. 
** in OBI we could keep it general, e.g. providing service to realize service provider role achieve providing service objective; 'DNA sequencing service' could be either defined by eagle-i or at the instance level. 
AI: Alan to provide one example worked out in the file for all to review and agree by next call on Wed (ideally)
** note that 'DNA sequencing service', 'DNA sequencing training service' were added into OBI during the workshop as test; once agrement is reached changes to these may be needed
** 'education, teaching and training' roles may not fit into OBI, perfectly, but it in absence of a relevant reference ontology these will stay in OBI

'''March 3'''

Chair: AR

* OBI workshop: attendees list, presentations, agenda

'''March 1'''

Chair: MC

Action items:
* AI for AR: take discussion with Oliver, Larisa, Jie, Dirk (JBMS figures)
* AI for Jie: mireot ChEBI terms in, try and find more information to help ChEBI add the 2 missing compounds
* AI for JF: clean up hierarchy under label
* AI for MC/Jie: send use case of "dye"
* AI for JM: create tracker item for specimen (circular definition)


Minutes: 

I/ JBMS paper figures 
AR: I looked at the text. I don't think there need to be changes.

CS: if the originators of the use case are happy then it's fine with me and I suspect with everyone else.

AI for AR: take discussion with Oliver, Larisa, Jie, Dirk 



II/ Jie's terms requests

1. Label compounds https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2955065&group_id=177891&atid=886178

2. Labeled RNA, Labeled DNA (related to a labeling process) https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2915152&group_id=177891&atid=886178

3. Terms related to a storage process https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2955131&group_id=177891&atid=886178

4. Plan specification or objective specification terms https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2902267&group_id=177891&atid=886178

Items 1, 2 seem to be solved easily. I'd like to discuss those terms first.

Item 4 may need some time. Chris and I have generated design patterns for those terms. The details have been attached to the tracker item. The attached file is DesignType-20100215.xls. If possible, I suggest you can check the file before our discussion. 

1. ChEBI terms

How to submit terms to ChEBI: successful use of tracker (AR, MC, BP). submission tool: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/submissions/login (PRS)

a) mireoting chebi terms: all attendees ok. 
AI for Jie: mireot those in, try and find more information to help ChEBI add the 2 missing compounds. (AR: Link: http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/pdf/bioprobes.Par.28435.File.dat/bp47_9.pdf for the fluors that cites the patents. Jie, would you mind adding this to the tracker, and if we send back to chebi, to include this info?)

b) label/dye role

Consensus: mireot chebi terms, add label role to the relevant ones for now. Clean up label hierarchy and if we keep dye role we'll add the restriction there
AI for JF: clean up hierarchy under label
AI for MC/Jie: send use case of "dye"


2. labeled RNA, labeled DNA

consensus: have labeled material as output of labeling process, with subclasses such as labeled RNA, labeled DNA...: we wouldn't have sub processes labeling RNA process (process not very interesting for OBI)

 CS use case: labeled RNA: take input as RNA, enzymatic process -> copies which have fluo tag and hybridize hat to reporters on an array. output = quantification of DNA or RNA species
AR: labeling done uniformely to DNA or RNA, chemical modification to produce new substance
MC: specimen in MA: solution of labeled oligonucleotide you throw on your array


JM: side issue: definition of specimen circular. AI for JM: create tracker item

BP adding labeled specimen and labeled RNA specimen to file


3. Terms related to a storage process
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2955131&group_id=177891&atid=886178

4. Plan specification or objective specification terms
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2902267&group_id=177891&atid=886178

Items 1, 2 seem to be solved easily. I'd like to discuss those terms first.

'''February 22th, 2010 (Mon)''' - Chair LS

Attended: BP, MC, JM, LS, JT, AR, PRS, JZ

* Report from OBOF meeting:
to be in OBOF, OBI needs independent users, min 2 DBs

include this into the agenda for f2f meeting?

AI: BP will put slides from OBOF

* Broken reasoning on current file:

Alan will look into it and give recommendations

* Eagle-I + Chris Mungall requests, and process for acting on requests in general. http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2921944&group_id=177891&atid=886178 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2937606&group_id=177891&atid=886178 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2935433&group_id=177891&atid=886178

4 options were proposed:

1 - discuss each item on a call - no one agreed

2 - review by 2-3 OBI people - not very popular either

3 - assign ID and remove if there is something wrong - popular option

4 -  let eagle-i do that, need training - popular option
combine 3+4 - very popular option

5 - they build on obi in sep owl file and bring it to us for review

AI: add to agenda on wiki for f2f - have obi slims for tests option 5

AI: Alan to try separate files

* What do we need before the OBI meeting in Vancouver?
* Do we need to change the figure captions in the OBI/JBMS paper?

AI: LS make minor changes to captions, send the text, contact the Editors

* Discuss: plan specification or objective specification terms requested by MGED ontology. The details on the tracker: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/func=detail&aid=2902267&group_id=177891&atid=886178

1. term submission policy

The term submission section refers to the quick ID proposal which was never finalized/implemented (http://obi-ontology.org/page/Quick_id#Submit_a_term_to_OBI), and use the old branches file system which is now obsolete. 

Decide to move forward with this proposal (and assign people to work on it) or decide that it doesn't fit our needs anymore and update the wiki accordingly. 

  No use case for Quick ID proposal now. Put it as low priority. QTT might supercede this in the future.
  Term submission: go with tracker items.


2. Material type related terms needed by MO
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2915152&group_id=177891&atid=886178

<br>Alan has posted a proposal
http://obi-ontology.org/page/Units_and_unit_labels

5. other tracker items if we have time left

  Comments were added into the tracker items.

'''January 20th, 2010 (Wed)''' - Chair CS
1. survival assessment: edit process issues - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2932146&group_id=177891&atid=886178
Submitted by Chris/Jie, no assignee.

2. review analyte assays - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2909866&group_id=177891&atid=886178
Submitted by Alan, assigned to Bjoern
If I remember correctly this was deemed as pretty straightforward  
during last call - any update?

3. obsolete terms needed by MO - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2919429&group_id=177891&atid=886178
Submitted by Jie, assigned to Helen

Note that out of the tracker items above, 2 relate to application of  
our deprecation policy. Is there any issue with the application of the  
policy, linked to editing or else?

4. validated information - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2898826&group_id=177891&atid=886178
Submitted by Melanie, assigned to Chris. Some comments from Bjoern.

5. MIREOT of UO terms - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2896765&group_id=177891&atid=886178
Submitted by Jie, no assignee.
Status is "awaiting formal proposal from Alan" - I think we reached  
agreement and the scripts have been updated accordingly, so this  
should be fairly straightforward.

6. MIREOT ChEBI deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid under nucleic acid instead of molecular entity

'''January 11th, 2010 (Mon)''' - Chair JM

We discussed the agenda for the Vancouver meeting. There was a suggestion that we might use this meeting perform a lot of outreach activities, e.g. inviting external groups along and give them a short course on how to use OBI, how to construct terms, QTT, MIREOT, IAO and so on.
There was also a suggestion that we might charge a small fee for registration to help cover some costs.

(1) decision for dates Vancouver workshop - http://www.doodle.com/k23civzzq2xr2d38

(2) Priority 7 Tracker items

'''January 4th, 2010 (Mon)''' - Chair OH

Attendees: OH, BP, JM, JT, HP, CT, MC

(1) OBI chair list: The previous order can be used.
AI: OH will update the page and re-use previous order. 

(2) Terms related to MO (http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/index.php): The long-term goal of the MGED ontology (MO) is to have it replaced by OBI in the future. The defs need reworking. It's possible to break down some of these into design patterns for QTT (quick terms template) tool. We also discussed other issues, such as ways to define mouse strains (e.g., C57 inbred mouse). Chris will think more about different choices. 

AI: Jie, Hp will see if we can develop patterns and use QTT tool.
 
(3) AI: HP will work with MH (Melissa Haendel) to get defs for her terms and we will see if these are QTT. Working with BRO will be an agenda item for the next coord call.
 
(4) The JBMS paper is basically accepted. We need to make the final update and submission by Jan 20th (LSS is the corresponding author). 

AI: Oliver will add some more OBI background to the paper to address a reviewer's comment; Oliver will put together a few sentences of discussion about granularity in the paper based on today's discussion.

AI: Jessica will do a final sanity check after OH makes his changes.

AI: OH will coordinate the getting figs for the JBMS paper in consistent format.

(5) Workshop status - 22nd March is a preferred week. Need to close the doodle by Wed.

Postpone discussion on policy for making changes to policy until later call
MGED Ontology: JZ has mapped terms, CS, HP and JM have reviewed; will import into OBI 1.0

Tracker items:
Manuscript: BP has received last minute edits which are good and which he will incorporate
Title: The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations seems to win

James Malone: i closed a couple of dt related ones
Helen Parkinson: I closed a lot of fixed things. 

Focus of discussion: immortal cell
tracker items: 2894003, 2892283, 2906085
In OBI now: immortalized cell line; output of:  cell line immortalization and establishing a cancer cell line
immortalized cell line has grain (some or only) immortal cell

cell culture: a cell culture is a material entity consisting of a population of cells that is maintained in vitro; children: clonal cell culture, primary cell culture, cell line culture

in general a cell line culture is considered to be homogeneous, stardardized, named, something which can be obtained reproducibly.  it will have an original tissue source and associated history of being made immortal through natural, disease or in-vitro process

a primary cell culture is not homogeneous, generally not immortal, and not a cell line culture

added two processes to OBI:
cell line immortalization 
has specified  output some immortalized cell line culture

establishing a cancer cell line has specified input some immortal cell 
has specified output some immortalized cell line culture

immortal cell:
a cell derived from a multicellular organism that has the potential to replicate indefinitely

AI JF: add tracker item summarizing discussion, diferentiating clonal cell culture, other terms.

In today's OBI dev call, the main task was still to go through tracker items 9 and 8, which are high priorities for the main OBI release paper. Many items in these two categories have been discussed, and eventually closed, reassigned, or downgraded.
 
We have also discussed the policy for the JBMS paper authorship. The final agreement agreed by all attendees in today's OBI call is that we will include all the authors signed up on the web page:
http://obi-ontology.org/page/Sig_paper_vote
including their names and affiliations. In the end of the author line, we will include the name "the OBI consortium". The OBI consortium will also be listed in the section of acknowledgements.

Agenda: task assignment for cleanup meeting

Review IEDB use case - BP

Review DT use case - JM

Text for CT use case in paper is out of date, (aspirin etc)

'''October 7, 2009'

Chair: HP


Call summary 7 Oct 09

1. We have now completed enough detail for the clinical trials use case 
to support the original aim - to show the breadth of OBI vs the glucose 
use case which shows depth

2. We discussed what we need to complete and in what granularity, 
remaining issues are
    2.1 Statistical test - discussion on what are the inputs and we 
don't have enough info in the paper on what the test was. AR and JF will 
work offline to model what they think is going on
    2.2 Hypothesis - we understand this to be 'fucoidan may have 
anticoagulant activity in vivo. result is a small stat sig effect of AT3 
anticoagulant effect, author interpretation indicates no useful clinical 
effect.
    2.3 Modelling the dosing regime - we decided to do this using day 
processes instances, with subparts, and these will be related using 
preceded by. AR will work on this. 

We understand that

we will not model time triggers now
we do not need instances for all patients, one representative for each 
group is enough
we will not work on this use case in Philly, but working on it later is 
desirable
   
3. 12 October we will review the IEDB use case, and the DT one. All will 
look at the paper in advance. BP will present the IEDB one, JM will 
present the DT one. We are hoping to have a screenshot from NCBO for the 
last use case. If we don't get this we will need to work around.

4. Next week 12 Oct the chair will be Bjoern. As he is presenting if 
would help I can chair again.


'''October 5, 2009'''

Chair:JF

====September 2009====

'''September 30. 2009'''

Chair:JZ Present: AR, BP, JM, RB, HP, JF, MC, YH, LS

1. Progress on SIG paper
http://obi-ontology.org/page/Sig_paper_vote
* which use cases should be used in the paper
* assign at least 2 people for each use case
   Oliver will propose the plan for working on the use cases for SIG paper and organize a call to work on the SIG use cases.
   Will go case by case together to reach the consistency for all the use cases. 
   The proposed order is Oliver's use case first, then laris's then Dirk's.

2. epitope: ?role/disposition/quality/other

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2870427&group_id=177891&atid=886178
   Want to change it like "epitope realizable entity" later.
   BP and AR will improve the definitions so they are clearer.

3. glucose figure for OBI paper
* shall we change "portion of blood" to "blood specimen"? (JF's answer: NO)
   add labels in legend
   change 'portion of blood' to 'blood specimen'
   change the relation of blood and tube filled with blood from 'part_of' to 'contained_in'   

4. Clinical trials use case
   BP: We want to model the process of an assay measured data item (output of assay) which is input to 
   a 'statistical hypothesis test' which has as an outpt a p-value. Based on the p-value, the authors reach 
   a conclusion that it is significant or not. 
   will continue discussion in the next dev call

5. Tacker items

'''September 28, 2009'

Chair: JM

* Progress on paper - BP

* progress on SIG paper
 
* clinical trials use case (paper now available)
  * AR to present changes

  Alan has been working on adding some additional classes and instance to the investigation use case file.
  JF: we are using terms a bit carelessly.  placebo is not synonymous with all negative controls; i had not thought subject was a thing but a role
  AR: modeled in detail now, but we may generalize e.g. "informing/communication" process and have different participants/ information entities
  JF: distinction for this use case between pill and capsule prob not needed, though details are likely useful
  It was clear from the work Alan has done that we do not know how to limit the scope of the use cases we are 
  building and when we have satisfied them. As such will endeavour to draw up a list of competency questions 
  which we will use to determine when we have satisfied our use case.
  AI: AR will doc the classes defined in terms of instances as a design pattern
  AI: JF to draw up list of competency questions for the clinical trial use case for Wed call


'''September 23 2009'''

Chair: CS Attending: CS, MC, HP, JF, JZ, BP

Clinical Trials use case continues:

*summary of progress: http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0Aagyu8cVTs1OZGY2MjY5aHZfMTEyZzJocXFuYzM&hl=en

*slides: http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/trunk/docs/papers/release/Figures/Clinical%20usecase9-10b.ppt?view=log

Continued discussion focussing on the Study Design Execution.

  - decision to not put the level of detail in the figure for the antithrombin-III (AT3) analyte assay as shown 
    in the glucose assay since it will already be in the paper and need to keep use case figure simple.
  - edited OBI file to include discussion.
  AI: HP has checked out file and incorporating discussion from today and Monday
  - decision to add classes to main file for fucoidan, guar gum, and AT3 so that we could create instances in OBI-use case file.
    -- fucoidan and AT3 are not in ChEBI so should submit. 
    -- from Wikipedia:
  AI: Submit fucoidan and antithrombin-III terms to ChEBI
  - likely need a blood collection tube (as opposed to flow cytometer collection tube) but for now may use 
    generic tube entered for glucose assay.
  - model AT3 assay as analyte assay with analyte = AT3.
    -- output of assay is measurement. Need to sort out what are the units and make sure in OBI.
  AI: JF will track down units needed
  - in OBI use case, created instance of a fucoidan treated homo sapiens and guar gum treated homo sapiens.
    -- will likely need to create more but this is a start
  - issue with modeling treatment. Options are as a generic treatment or as subparts of a process. 
    JF strongly prefers the latter but we need a way to link inputs and outputs to describe the same person get successive treatments.
  AI: AR will model by Sept. 28 (as discussed on previous call) or we go with generic treatment approach.
  - need to capture data transformation of collection of measurements from the AT3 assay.
    -- They used a statistical test (i.e., generated a P-value) but not clear which test (don't want to say t-test if don't know for sure). 
  AI: JF will check on test

----------------------------------------------------------
'''September 14 2009'''

Present: HP (Chair), JM, AR, CC, JF, JZ, CS, MC, PRS

=== 1. SIG paper === 
Oliver's offered to work on this, but we need to make a decision as these are now in same time frame. Various views expressed:

Option A. We work on both papers, we proposed asking Oliver to coordinate the work on the SIG paper

Option B. We work on the main OBI paper and don't do the SIG

Option C. We work on the SIG paper and defer main paper.

AI: Add to Wednesday's discussion as neither BP or OH were on the call and if necessary vote on the wiki.

=== 2. Clinical trial use case ===

Slides were edited (rather than OWL file) and will be checked in to sf.

AI: PRS suggested we should liase with the OCI/OCRE re: clinical terms and he'll follow up with OCRE (OCI is inactive at present) (after 2 weeks due to other work) to see what their status is. AR suggested check OGMS. In the meantime we will add terms as we need them for this use case

http://code.google.com/p/ogms/
Alan Ruttenberg: OCRE: http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/40170

1. study design was unresolved last week. We discussed adding single blind trial design and decided that this should be defined in terms of the process rather than adding a new term. There are still then multiple study design terms that describe the use case and we need all of these still.

2. Drug role - def. reviewed, agreed that it's too tight now and will be relaxed so we can use it in this use case. We will add a new defined class which is 'approved drug role' - output of some approval process which will work for the original def of drug role.

AI: HP will redefine drug role more generally for this use case - DONE
AI: approved drug role needs to be added as does approval process - HP will create tracker item

3. excluded study participant role - this is now in a placeholder _under discussion. We decided that we don't need to assign roles here, and this role will be deprecated and not used in the use case.  JM modified slides.

AI:deprecate excluded study part role - DONE

4. study participant role - discussion on whether this is needed, in a workshop FG and others expressed the view that this be deprecated. It's not used and we will use study subject instead.

AI: HP will dep. this term and repoint the obsoleted 'potential study participant role' to 'study subject' - DONE

5. Person/Homo sapiens, discussion that these are instances of Homo sapiens and not people. Agreed, we'll use Homo sapiens in this use case

6. Discussion on how we can label the two groups - treated and untreated. There's no role for this only 'study treatment group' which refers to both those treated with the query or active compound vs. the control one. These can be modelled as processes but we have no process terms for these yet. Not completed.

7. Suggestion by JF that 'study population role' be deprecated, there are more specific roles which can be logically defined. 

AI: HP will deprecate this term. - DONE and child terms asserted under role

Proposal to delete those before 1.0
Concerns that those obsolete classes sometimes record design decision, and that we should ensure we don't loose that information
Best place for design decisions is not in obsolete classes, but we will keep obsolete classes information somewhere

====August 2009====

'''August 31 2009'''
Dev Call - chair YH (Oliver)

Attendants: JF, BP, YH (Oliver), MC, AR, HP, CS, CC. 
 
NOTES:
1. ONTIE merging: ONTIE has been mergerd to OBI.
 
(1) However, the reasoner does not work well. We may need to contact Pellet developers. Pellet 2 ok in command line or P4. Pellet 1.5 doesn't work in P3 or command line. There should be a P4.1 version coming soon. We can switch to it once it is ready. However, we may need to take temporary pain to make it work now.

(2) A strategy to show ONTIE terms are generated by IEDB originally for epitope research may be needed. One strategy is to use the 'definition source' with the content 'IEDB'. It may be better than ID range. 

AI for Alan: However, a new annot prop or another strategy may be needed. Alan will add a tracker item to iao to record such notification requests.  

(3) All ONTIE terms will be included for OBI v1.0 release and will be assigned OBI IDs when releasing. Bjoern will make sure all ONTIE terms are curated well.
 
2. Manuscript will be submitted after clean up workshop.
 
3. NCBI taxonomy terms. Current taxnonomy terms in OBI are probably overloaded. OntoFox ( http://ontofox.hegroup.org ) is a good program that will be used for possible cleanup. We will need do the following steps proposed by Alan and Oliver:

1) Collect leaf terms we want in OBI;

2) Run ontofox methods on these. Three OntoFox methods are available and all used for this run: includeNoIntermediaaries, includeSensibleIntermediaaries, and includeAllIntermediaaries.

3) Inspect all results for review. We will then decide which one will be used for OBI. 

This will be implemented by Oliver's group.

We may need to generate disjoints among NCBITaxon terms, or this may need to be done by NCBITaxon itself.
 
4. OBI specific 'homo sapiens'. This term has different meaning compared to the NCBITaxon Homo sapiens. See:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2843699&group_id=177891&atid=886178 = usage of 'homo sapiens'
It's more like person or organization that has legal entity role. So maybe it can be replaced with a name like 'legal entity' (this name may not be ideal, though). Currently we have ~15 cases where person and not homo sapiens could be used, devices, manufact. etc.
AI for Helen or Bjoen (?): paste this issue into the tracker. We will discuss it next call.
 
5. Bjoern will remove 'has_output' in OBI.
 
6. AI for Alan: Clean up conferred qualities. Those would become defined material - eg irradiated becomes irradited material, i.e material output of irradiation process.


'''August 26 2009'''
Dev Call - chair JF

Atending:  AR, BP, CS, JF, MC, HP, JZ

AIs from last call:

(1) review CS assay design template:http://obi-ontology.org/page/Design_process

(2) review JZ list of terms in manuscript:http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/docs/papers/release/OBITerm-ids.xls
    
(3) documentation of discussion - email / tracker / calls
emails - thread name is often not reflective of discussion, so important topics can be difficult to find / follow
email format is virtually impossible to read once it is more that three deep - when should we trigger a summary?
FG: tracker discussions are missed by folks not following tracker -> ask all interested people to follow tracker?
complex issues cannot be easily discussed on paper / assigned to a single term in the tracker
 
AI: HP will summarize specified_in/output, and run it past FG.
JZ was tasked with documenting e-mail threads in tracker
 
Ongoing:
(4) Manuscript:  Need OBI developers to take on unassigned items!
* need to update figure 1 -> already in tracker
* species neutrality. Mention as a big issue across OBO Foundry ontologies
* Update logical definition of PBS buffer -> tracker
* better example of objective specification. AR: goal is to take something someone else has written in a protocol
* Redraw figure 2, replace 'depend ons' with 'inheres in'. -> JF tracker (error in fig 2)
* clean up information processing/ data transformation -> tracker (clustering paragraph paper)
* IAO section of paper
* add glucometer to OBI for paper
* person/Homo sapiens in OBI
 
(5) priority 9 tracker items
 
New items:
 
(6) hotel accomodation options for Cleanup Meeting  Accommodation options Chris/Jie/Helen
 
(7) HP and PL performed useful review of Role branch -- several issues raised also occur in other branches; is there a review underway of other branches?

  (1) discussed CS assay design template:http://obi-ontology.org/page/Design_process
  this is the place to document complex, generalizable decisions, e.g. analyte assay.  
  please add to sequencing example
 
  (2) documentation of discussion -> tracker
  AI from last call: HP summarize specified_in/output, and run it past FG; we have agreement
 
  (3) Clean up meeting will have a speaker phone
  hotel space:  evening of oct 17 may need to stay at airport and 
  CS will organize transport additional accomodation options in e-mail
  funding information - HP has funds on first come first served basis.
 
  (4) ms:
  a. changes to fig 2 acceptable; re-label taking sample -> taking specimen since this is more generic
  b. BP working on use cases:1 pp to introduce the problem pp #2 specifically formulates the use case /
  how OBI is used and figure to graphically display implementation in OBI
  c. HP: the content of the table is broken in 2 places, we need to fix the file or the use case; 
  missing use of spec input
  d. add note in text summarizing current state of implementation GenePattern
  e. AR will look at ONTIE/OBI
  f. BP to add terms from ms as defined classes; change regulatory agency to government regulator =

'''August 24 2009'''
Dev Call - chair CS
Attending: HP, JF, CS, JZ, BP, AR

AIs from last call:
*JZ has generated a table of terms mentioned in manuscript. This is checked into svn with the manuscript.
http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/docs/papers/release/OBITerm-ids.xls
*CS has drafted design template documentation for assays. Still needs work - please review and make suggestions for improvements
http://obi-ontology.org/page/Design_process

Documentation of email discussions:
JZ was tasked with documenting email threads in the tracker but it's not clear if that's the best place to put it and how to capture these discussions that always tie nicely to a term or a single tracker item. It is clear that we need to document these somehow otherwise we are doomed to repeat the discussions and waste time and effort. 
Proposal is to use current discussion on has_participant and has_specified_input as test case. Once we have summary, we can figure out the best place to put it as an agenda item.
AI: HP will summarize specified_in/output, and run it past FG. - Done, documented and resolved

Manuscript:
BP has gone through the comments from other readers and addressed for the most part. We went through comments and either made changes or added items to tracker. 
* calculate # of classes & relations -> tracker
* can use plural of terms in manuscript in order to make manuscript nice to read (also see tracker use of plurals in the manuscript). 
* need to update figure 1 -> already in tracker
* species neutrality. Mention as a big issue across OBO Foundry ontologies
* Update logical definition of PBS buffer -> tracker
* better example of objective specification. AR: goal is to take something someone else has written in a protocol
* Redraw figure 2, replace 'depend ons' with 'inheres in'. -> JF tracker (error in fig 2)
* clean up information processing/ data transformation -> tracker (clustering paragraph paper)
Also did same thing for the table that JZ generated - i.e., made adjustments to manuscript or added to tracker. Revised version checked into to svn at end of call
* IAO section of paper
* add glucometer to OBI for paper
*  person/Homo sapiens in OBI

Need OBI developers to take on unassigned items!

'''August 19 2009'''
Dev Call - chair LS

* Release progress

* BP: I think we need and should not define many sub-objectives of assay, 
but should simply rely on what the specified output is to define 
something like a sequencing assay

- Assays like Chip-seq or MeDip-seq should have a sequencing assay as a part, not classify as one. 

- I agree with what Alan wrote below, specifically that it is hard to get 
the logical definitions right. That does not mean we should give up on them, 
but that we should try to develop uniform design patterns. 
I think calls are best suited to establish those, and we should have several before the clean up meeting. 

* continue with the tracker

* JZ: Manuscript - Table with all terms in the manuscript + their OBI ID

 * AI for Jie: OBI terms used in manuscript and their IDs -will be done this week.
 * AI for Chris: a design template for sequencing assays. 
   BP adds quality - 'primary structure of macromolecule' is quality that should be in SO, added as a placeholder here  
   - sequence is info about a quality - from previous discussion with Chris Mungall. 
   - the spec output then for the seq assay is info about a quality 
   - this will be an IAO term for sequence needed as well. 
   can put design template here: http://obi-ontology.org/page/Design_process
 * AI (already done by Chris): put to the tracker sequence macromolecule, assign to BP.
 * AI  - the same for methylation state

'''August 17 2009'''
Dev Call - chair JM 

* Release progress

* Discussion of user deprecation docs - HP's AI from last call
 * http://obi-ontology.org/page/OBIDeprecationPolicy
 * Old page has been repointed, google doc AI's have been extracted to page
 * check for obsolete terms needs to be rolled into release process, tracker item added
 * What constitutes a deprecated term discussion? for RC1.0 will the following mean that a class is deprecated:
 
#If RDFS labels are changed?
#If there are axiomatic changes? E.g. new necessary and sufficient conditions
#If there are new asserted parents - ie a class is moved
#If text definitions are changed?
#If a MIREOT term is obsoleted

* Milestones check, OBI user docs and development docs need work

* Reminder to sign up for cleanup tasks

'''August 12 2009'''
Coord Call - chair BP
* Review of last action items (all done) 
 * new call schedule
 * ICBO poster
 * capture discussion on consortium consolidation on wiki

* OBI meetings 
 * cleanup meeting in October 2009
 * meeting early 2010

* OBI release of 0.9, 1.0
 * review tracker priority order: 9 influences writing, 
 8 needs to be fixed to accompany  manuscript submisssion 
 7 should be fixed before publication (during review process)

* OBI manuscript 

* release process documentation. 
 *HP had an AI to transfer docs on AR's application to the wiki

====July 2009====

'''July 29 2009'''
Dev Call - chair YH (Oliver). Attendants: JF, YH, JZ, CS, JM, BP, HP, PR, AR

Agenda (1): All the remaining high priority tracker items have been discussed: 
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=177891&atid=886178
Some items were closed during the talk. Some remain. Those that remain open and have priority of "9" include:
 
Item #1: 2829038  specified ... relations   2009-07-29  
Note: The 'has specified ... ' relations might need cleanup and not refer to roles any more. A feedback from Larissa and the Relation branch is needed to close this item. 
  
Item #2: 2828363  Raw Data vs Processed data  2009-07-28 
Note: We need original data for data (e.g, microarray data) analysis. Currently, IAO and OBI disagree in terms of measured data. May need to create an assay measurement data item in OBI. May still keep 'assay' in OBI, and then IAO reference OBI assay. Since Alan was not late and not in the discussion, James will bring it up in next IAO call.  
 
Item #3: 2827920  ONTIE term migration   2009-07-27 
NOTE: ONTIE has terms (like ELISA assay) to be included in OBI as classes. The ONTIE database also contains many epitope data that will be OBI instances. 
 
Item #4: 2827918  Include terms to allow query for Genepattern use case, 2009-07-27 
NOTE: This item was not specifically discussed for closure. However, we discussed a lot about mireoting existing terms from other ontologies for ArrayExpress microarray data analysis. See below.
 
Item #5: 2613561  action specification, 2009-02-18
NOTE: This item was not discussed.
  
Item #6: 2100531  mixtures of chemicals in Chebi, 2008-09-08 
NOTE: This item was not discussed.
 
Item #7: 1911447  release + documentation  2008-03-10 
NOTE: Alan, Jie, and Melanie have put a lot of time in OBI release. Alan targets to debug and make the release process work by this weekend. Allen from Oliver's lab has also been asked to develop a more generic Java-based version for late OBI release. Allen is currently working on this.
For OBI manuscript, now Melanie has it for review. Jen likes to re-join the review list.
 
Agendat (2): Helen indicates that ArrayExpress can suggest terms (typically tissues, parts, diseases, compounds) to MIREOT from other ontologies based on their EFO work. 
NOTE: we all agreed that many terms from well developed ontologies, such as CHEBI and FMA, can be mireoted. Ontologies should be ranked. It means that some terms from many ontologies may not mireoted. One solution is to put terms (such as disease related terms) that are not well defined in some seperate file or branches, and make notes for future cleanup. 
 
(3) We need to start planning our next face to face OBI meeting. Chris voluteered Philly.
NOTE: Current candidates: Phily, Stanford, Vancouver, and EBI. Many voted for Philly. Helen will check on Emerald funding from EBI. We may need to set up a doodle site for voting.
About timing: all agreed that the paper should be submitted first before we meet next time. Nov-Jan is good timing.
 
(4) James raised a question about MIREOTing classes into OBI. We may need to make some policy in terms of what ontologies we should import terms from. Some ontologies that are not orthogonal may need to be excluded. 
NOTE: all agreed. 
 
(5) A note from Helen: _cloning placeholder needs some work. Kevin Clancy and Bjoern had done quite a lot of work in this area.
NOTE: Helen is going to do more work on this.
 
(6) Broken links in OBI: http://obi-ontology.org/page/ . Now, the download link ( http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi.owl ) in this page is pointed to:
http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obi/releases/2009-01-28/merged/OBI.owl 
Note: the 2009-01-28 date is right. This is our most recent release. We need to generate a new release soon.
 
(7) DNA sequencing. Philippe has done some preliminary but nice work on including DNA sequencing in OBI. Discussions appeared to focus on how to make it more specifically and logically defined. Philippe has added DNA sequencing as a defined class. He also distinguished DNA sequencing by use of DNA ligase from DNA sequencing by use of DNA polymerase. DNA polymerase is already imported under protein complex. 
NOTE: not discussed.
 
(8) Where to add svn checkout instructions? Bjoern has laid out a very helpful and simple instruction.
NOTE: We may need to add this in wiki and read me file. We also need to freeze old wiki and only work to new wiki. However, it was often hard to know which is new wiki and which is old.

'''July 8 2009'''
Coord Call - chair BP

* OBI poster for ICBO
* Reducing the OBI consortium post-publication to active members only - including removing from SourceForge site
* Reducing dev calls to every 2 weeks
* Consolidation of OBI calls
* Creating an Information processing ontology outwith OBI
* Is OBI stalled? (Ryan wrote: It seems to me that OBI development has been somewhat stalled as of late. OBI seems to be just as fluid as it was two years ago, and releases are about as regular. If others agree, then what can we do to fix this? Perhaps identifying specific areas to focus efforts on and freezing these areas until 1.0 & paper is out once there is agreement might help?)

'''July  1 2009'''
Dev Call - chair CS
* Consistency checks on OBI for release. Current status and plans moving forward. Use of reasoner.
* When apply MIREOT? before merged .owl file created or after, or does it not matter?
* Plans for ICBO poster
* status of the manuscript. Who has it?
* IAO calls to start Tuesday 9 to 10 am PST (weekly to start with, once every other week later on). Melanie would like to start those on the 7th of July, to allow time for clean-up before the ICBO tutorial. There is a tracker at: http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/issues/list
* OBI at ISMB - feedback?

====June 2009====

'''June 24 2009'''
Dev Call - JM and CS chaired
Present: JM, CS, RB, AR, MC, JZ, OY
*Discussion on linking data to its visualization as a report graph. In general, it was agreed that some data is input to some data visualization process where some report graph is output. Issue is with how to specify types of report graphs such as dot plots. One option based on earlier discussions (at the F2F workshop) are to create a specific process such as dot plot visualization with output dot plot - so create a visualization process for each type of report graph. The other option is to just use a general process and use something like description logic safe rules that are under development. The consensus was that DL safe rules are not mature enough yet and we should stick with the first option that we all understand. 
 
AI: for JM to have a go at adding the data transformation visualization process, using the form has_input data and has_output graph report
*Jie has started working on OBI release and running into some problems. 
AI: MC and AR to help Jie with some release process issues
* DIscussion on MIREOT of terms with regard to whether to just bring in the term, its parent, or up to the root. For example, does PATO:dead belong directly under 'quality' or under 'monadic quality of continuant'? Agreed that it is better to at least bring in parent so that term can be placed better in OBI but current script just brings in term and would take some effort to fix. Oliver has developed a site with input from Melanie and Alan that solves this problem (see OntoFox at http://ontofox.hegroup.org/). 
AI: Jie will try OntoFox for MIREOT of PATO terms into OBI.

'''June 17 2009'''
Dev Call - chair JM
Present: JM, CS, RB, JF, MC, JZ, OY

*Went spent most of call giving overview of items discussed and agreed from workshop, including discussion with Envo, use case issues from journal paper, sample, specimen, change to has_input/output relations, BFO 2.0 and working with IAO.
*IAO work: Alan and Melanie are going to co-lead that ontology (in a similar way to lead editors in OBI branches) so we will be relying on them to initiate conference calls when necessary and follow up on/assign action items for things relating to IAO (as agreed at workshop).
*Next Workshop: two suggestions from call were (all only possibles at moment) UPenn in January and tying it in with PSB meeting in Hawaii.  We would welcome any other suggestions from people.
*Reminder of next few call chairs given

*restructuring of OBI coord / devel
*Polymorphism community Michelle and Erick to relay Tina for the [http://obi-ontology.org/page/Consortium Consortium]
*Progress on only asserting Realizable_enitites, directly under the class realizable enity and not asserting classes under role, function or disposition. The current classes under function and role need to be moved and defined as generic realizable entities, removing the suffixes. This process has been endorsed by Barry as an acceptible way forward. For the specifics see [http://hdl.handle.net/10101/npre.2009.3228.1 Phil's paper], as its easier to follow than the email thread
*How to use subversion: The purpose of subversion is to enable one document to be revisioned. You can roll back between revisions so nothing is lost and add tags to describe specfic version. In other words we should only ever have one copy of a document that gets revisioned, rather than multiple copies of the same document which has appeared under the release folder, for the release manuscript and the ismb paper. Can we svn:delete everything under the papers folder that is not the current document.

*Remove (Pseudo)-Redundance and experimental stuff from release file
**E.g. now we have unmarked helper-bins such as OBI_function and PATO_quality as well as this (pseudo-)redundancy e.g. Protocol, Protocol_aplication, Protocol_application_role, _defined_protocol_aplication, all in the release file.
**Does it make sense to release differrent views on the ontology, e.g. one with (for developers) and one without experimental stuff (for endusers/biologists)?
*Check all inherited properties on correctness' as part of OBI checkup policy?
**E.g. currently all instruments inherit an OBI: 'is_reagent_in' relation to 'protocol application' (asserted on the independent_continuant' class level). I think this is not very intuitive and it should be asserted deeper down the hierarchy or renamed in a more general wording so that it still applies to the leaf node level. Accordingly all inherited properties could be checked on applicability on the leaf node level. Use the properties view instead of the logics view to see all inherited relations.
*What is the status of "help request for setting nested/composite restrictions in protege (e.g. material has_part (cell has_part virus))", and where is that documented ?

====March 2008====
'''Mar. 26, 2008'''
* Developers call - Chair: James
**ISMB abstract submission

** if quorum present, quickly go over decisions from previous call and confirm them.

as a reminder:


1/ import policy

The import policy has been approved by all members present. It will be used from now on, with the reserve that it can be revised if any problem becomes apparent.

2/ update of minimal metadata page

Proposal to change the cardinality of definition_source to 1...n (instead of 1 currently).
Attendees don't see any objection to do so, and leaving the curators free to put 1 or more sources.
However, there had been previous objections by others who were not attending the call, so we think that this should be re-discussed.

3/ implementation of the obi-users list

Attendees agree on using Google groups. Again, there has been some objection before, so will need to be re-discussed.
It would be nice to formalize the decision of using Google groups for our mailing-lists in the future. This has already been discussed and we thought it was agreed upon: due to recurrent problems with sourceforge lists, we would switch to google groups. We already mirrored the sourceforge mailing-lists on google for archiving purpose, and the latest lists (biomaterial, denrie, obi-owl) have been created under google.

4/ SVN and documentation

DT branch expressed the need for having a directory under SVN where to store for example spreadsheets for their branch.
All attendees agree that there is no problem with that. We also agreed that we would like to have 2 distinct documentation directories, one for user documentation and one for development documentation. We could even have a link http://purl.org/obo/obi/documentation/ for the user documentation.
This will be dealt with during SVN reorganization.
Note: Liju commented that her branch already uses google doc and wishes to keep this, as there is a version control system. Everybody agreed that it is up to the branches to decide how to proceed, the DT proposal is for archiving of non-edited anymore documents for example.

5/ Function

In Vancouver it has been decided to let the Protocol Application branch define the function in the context of the protocol they create and where they specify the function of instruments.
But function is more than just realizing a process, it also specifies the mode of participation of the bearer in the process.
Bill point to a page on the wiki with examples : https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/ObiFunctionUseCases

There is still some confusion between role and function. Bill is in contact with "function gurus" to try and sort out things, and will come back to the instrument branch (who submitted functions) with more information as soon as possible.

The consensus (amongst attendees) is to clearly mention the function in the definition for the moment, and submit it under the tracker. Bill will liaise with Bjoern to see how to create processes and function, on the model "some independent continuant is the bearer of a function and participates in a process". The needed relations are already in OBO_REL.

6/ OBI wikipedia page

James proposed to create a wikipedia page for OBI, now that we enter a release cycle. All attendees agree.


** last vote on the wiki regarding tracking system https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/ActionItems/Votes
** use "clinical investigation" instead of "medical" on our website. (Alan tested a google search with "medical experiment")
** SVN reorganization - proposal to be reviewed: could be implemented for next release, beginning of april.
** What do we we do regarding import of non-obofoundry ontologies?<br>
e.g., John Westbrook's ontology (PDBO.obo) is in OBO format and non-foundry, and DT would like to import some terms: do we convert to owl, then slurp in terms? can we use it if non foundry?


Note: Call time will be one hour earlier for those on GMT (this changes to BST on 30th March which is GMT+1hour)

'''Mar. 19, 2008'''

- lead the discussions and ensure we keep on track on those,<br>
- take the notes and post them (or liaise with Allyson/Melanie to have them posted)<br>
**Discuss use of svn properties (e.g. revision, date...)<br>
TheRest.owl contains versionInfo 0.6.7
**Officially retire the protege auto_id plug-in

cf changes proposed with the release:
- use of purl, e.g. http://purl.org/obo/OBI_0100102
- use of "/" as a separator instead of "#"
- assign IDs to everything (including relations)

====February 2008====
'''Feb. 28, 2008'''
* Developers call
**Discuss implementation policy for votes that have been accepted on the 20th.<br>
1. curation_status: new values - cardinality<br>
2. definition_source: update of the annotation property file and all the branch files<br>
**Discuss release policy<br>
1. Files have to be checked when committing into SVN<br>
2. Various pre-releases check, J-8, J-3<br>
3. email on dev if problems: the branches have to check/correct their respective files<br>
4. If inconsistency/problem -> no release.<br>

'''Feb. 20, 2008'''
* Developers call
** Discuss the use of the curation_status annotation property <br>
We need to decide if we want to release all the terms, including their curation_status, and oducment it as suggested by Bill:  "...expectation to be set would be that anything other than those  
with "review complete" should be considered likely to change place in  
hierarchy or have definition refined, or be obsoleted in the next  
release".<br>
The other option is to release only terms with curation_status "complete" (name to be defined following vote), and not their annotation property curation_status. One issue is that ant term deemd "complete" which is an IS_A term curation "incomplete" will not be released. As described by Alan: "For instance, if a class has 'curation_status' 'review_complete', but one of its IS_A asserted graph ancestors is NOT 'review_complete', we'll not be able release that term, since we won't be able to construct its ancestor graph.  This would also cause problems for classes using ObjectProperty relations.  If one of the classes referred to in a class restriction are not 'review_complete', this would at least keep us from releasing that class with its restrictions.  We'd need to simply leave the restrictions out.  This might lead to a released, merged OBI that's considerably smaller than we all might expect"

see discussion thread at http://groups.google.com/group/obi-developer/browse_thread/thread/d8a0890c191661fb?hl=en

DECISION: we agreed that for the moment we will release all the terms and their annotation properties. This might be modified in the future with progress made on OBI. Release notes will clearly state  that the status of this release is "not to be used in production - things may (and probably will) change"

** Organizations <br>
How to deal with them. Who will take care of that branch? Should be independent?<br>

DECISION: We will keep person and organization (in the sense of aggregate of person) under material. Organization is to be replaced by population. The role branch will create the necessary organization_roles for these to bear. The classes under material represent the physical part of the concept, and they bear roles representing the social status associated to these.<br>
Side note: We had a discussion about how to represent for example "sigma". It has been decided that this would be an instance of reagent_supplier_role (or chemical_supplier) for example. Again, the role branch will create the appropriate classes.

** Spatial regions <br>
Instrument branch identified several terms that are spatial regions. These have been moved under spatial regions at the moment. What is the bfo status of this branch?

DECISION: discussion postponed until Alan/Bill on the call.

** SVN tidyup, to have single folder for ontology. Suggested structure and assignment of task.

DECISION: Daniel volunteered to clean up SVN. He will circulate a proposal of action for this before modifying the current structure.

** Sourceforge tracker review

AI for everybody: review the terms and assign them.
By default, terms related to branch will be assigned to branch leaders. E.g., cohort_role will be assigned to Jennifer as leader of the role branch.
Comments are to be posted on the tracker items when action is taken towards resolution.

====January 2008====
'''Jan. 16, 2008'''
* Developers call
** Discuss use of Quality and PATO
** Further discussion of resolving and documenting prolonged development issues (James, all)
** Resolve citation vs source if major advocates are on call. (Daniel, Alan)
** Use of annotation property (Melanie)
 
'''Jan. 9, 2008'''
* Coordinators call
** Community/Collaborative issues
**# letter of support for PATO
**# PDB community and workshop
**# NCBI grant to evaluate and extend Collaborative Protege (D. Rubin, M. Musen, N. Noy)
** Development issues
**# Clean up wiki regarding the development policies methodology section (Frank)
**# Proposal on using voting to solve ongoing discussions like analyte. (Melanie)
**#* When an issue seems unsolvable (e.g. current analyte discussion) among the community, a community member can submit a request to the coordinating committee (CC) to put the issue to a vote. 
**#* The coordinating committee then decides to either put this issue to vote by the whole community, or alternatively can decide to solve the issue between coordinators (for example by voting only among members of the CC) 
**#* Voting should be open for at least a month (cf point 1.3.2 of the OBI Regs) 
**#* Voting behavior (either by CC members or by the whole community) will be made public (cf point 1.3.5 of OBI Regs) 
**# Questions for advisors (from last weeks developers call)
**#* gaps in ontology coverage - e.g., no quantitative values (note: Alan Rector has way of doing this)
**#* issues resolved or postponed in OBI, general use of roles
**#* old issues with biomaterial:
**#*# biomaterial hard to define: something of interest, biological origin?
**#*# granularity (Frank, Matthew)
**#*# multiple inheritance
**#* General properties, eg definition, overall structure of OBI
**#* uses cases/competency questions
**#*# how to apply use cases and competency questions to OBI.
**#*# question for advisors: given these questions and the current status of OBI are we ready?
**#*# Want to solicit Robert and Frank to get new questions (relevant for use with NCIt, Mygrid, etc.) Frank (in the context of the Thesaurus) and curators are trying to do fair amount of logical definition. This will be the next step for OBI, put more logical definitions in. We should get his advice on that.

====December 2007====

'''Dec. 19, 2007'''

- finalize decision on space/underscore: no objections on that, so I propose that we definitively say we will use the space as a separator. We would need to update the wiki (maybe Daniel would volunteer as our "naming convention guru"  :-)  ) and then we need to decide how we are going to modify the current terms. (per branch responsibility seems logical)

'''DECISION: Use space as separator.'''

- it would be nice also to get a general agreement on the following (which are non sensitive issues)

1. cardinality of definition_editor: in case we have several editors for a definition, do we put them all in one field (and with which separator?) or do we create distinct annotations. The instrument branch proposes to have several annotations (<definition_editor>Daniel Schober</definition_editor><definition_editor>Franck Gibson</definition_editor>...)

'''DECISION: Use 1:1 cardinality.'''


2. cardinality of definition_citation/source: same than above do we put everything in one field or do we separate, Again, the Instrument branch used the latter. (note: here I am not talking about the name source or citation, just the cardinality). The current cardinality on the minimal metadata page is 1 (https://wiki.cbil.upenn.edu/obiwiki/index.php/MinimalMetadata), so would need to be changed

'''DECISION: Use 1:1 cardinality.'''

The above issues are just "technicalities" we need to agree on and that are currently holding us back in the curation work we are doing in Instrument and Data_transformation branches.

Then a few "problematic" issues:

- the annotation "curation_status" and its value "curation_complete". The instrument branch has bee using it to say "the term is clean" in the sense definition and metadata are ok. We used it in conjunction with other curation_status annotation, so for example a term cleaned but that we think might move in the hierarchy is curation_status complete and curation_status graph_position_temporary (the cardinality of curation_status on the minimal metadata page is 1...n)
However, as Trish mentioned, for some people it actually means "term ready for release and won't (probably) move again". This is also a reasonable approach in the sense that moving a term in the hierarchy would probably imply modifying the definition as pointed out by James. Trish also proposed to have the cardinality of the curation_complete status set to one, which means using that value we would not be allowed to use any other curation_status in conjunction with it.

'''DECISION: Melanie, James, Bill and Alan will draw up list with definitions for use, cardinality will be 1:n'''

- the OBI IDs: some terms don't have any, and most of the time they are heterogeneous (between 2 and 10 digits for example). This seems to me to be an important issue, the IDs in the context of an ontology are very central as they represent the concept in the annotation made by our users.
The proposal (James, Daniel and me) is that the lead editor of each branch takes care of that. We need uniform IDs, OBI_6digits, and we need to have the autoID files under SVN https://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/branchDevelopment/trunk/lastac_autoID/ 

FG: I can tidy up the wiki for the development policies/methodology section and remove duplication - Apologies I will be unable to attend the call but can someone let me know the outcome, thanks.
