==Agenda Items carried over from Wednesday==

===8. Revisiting other agenda items suggested Monday pm to decide what to do===

* Env ontology discussion. Suzi Lewis has posted a response re: Michael Ashburners GEO project.
SS reports that Dawn Field is organising a workshop for Env ontology in August. 
JF:I recall was including lab or experimental env that obi needs. Need to be clear if the lab env will be part of the env. ontology or as part of them working with OBI. Dawn Field is part of OBI
CS:We need field isolates e.g. for parasites, we will need what they cover.

<b>AA:Susanna to communicate the above and feedback</b>


* Liju, are we going to reserve some time to go over terms in each branch
HP:We will not have time to do that, too many
CS:If there are questions about terms, suggest raise them, need to trust the branches. Expect people to go through the branches if they want to. We could set aside problem terms
HP:we need to address flagging unclassified terms consistently before we can do that

* How to link to the external ontologies, Bill identified has a way to do that in BIRNLEX. Would be good to have him show that, today

JM:Not sure if you can import a subset of an OWL ontology, one way round is to create a local subset and import that as a 'view'

<b>AA:Allyson emails Bill to ask for a summary of how OBI should address point 10 below.</b>

===9. Flagging 'helper classes', e.g. items that are 'unclassified', consistently===

We check vs. previous meta data terms we noted some to be added.

Placeholder till something can be referred out to belong in some external ontologies
Placeholder for a set of collected terms.

CS:under curation status there are a list of terms 

JM:'temporary class' ?
AL:want to make a difference between things that will be referred out to other ontologies.
we add a new meta data 'awaiting external mapping' These have been added to the wiki by AL.
CS:if editors want to not classify terms under an existing class, they should them hanging free under their branch root.
BP:would prefer a to put in a holding class as James suggested
CS:if we have a consistent temp class that would be fine
BP:Should it be Protocol_Application_temporary
LF:there's a string search can find anything you want to.
.
<b>AA:All branches to add branchname_temporary and use it consistently. This class will not need to have any meta data annotation as this doesn't merit it.</b>
<b>AA:Ask Trish to send the code for making the figure</b>
<b>Add a new item to SOP for reasoning</b>
<b>Identified people able to support reasoning : Daniel, James, Alan, Gilberto, Allyson</b>


'''DS: The use of only one 'branchname_temporary' helper class per branch might not be enough''' to cover our branches needs. It will force us to overload this with meanings, e.g. as the list above indicates, people might want to have some more specialised helper classes, e.g. a '_refactor_as_relation' 'awaiting external mapping' , '_submit_to_xy_branch' or whatever. It would be nice to give Editors more freedom here. Also the required helper classes are morst probably branch specific as well.  I would suggest to have these on the branch top level/branch root and indicate their status with the underscore prefix. The uinderscore prefix serves as search string(startswith) and also renders helper classes easy visible in the hierarchy. The _underscore is recognized in the hierarchy more easily as when using just a normal looking names like branchname_temporary ("_temporary" postfix). We need to identify needed helper classes (on a branch and on a general level), and what info do we want to see immediately in the hierarchy (and use for browsing), and what info we want to keep via annotation properties (the ones we want to do more fancy querying on). Then later we can review all of these and probably re-formulate as part of some metadata standard.

===10. Referencing, mapping to, or importing (subsets of) external ontologies from/into OBI===



Bill will be joining at 11.30

===11. SOP for ontology development, PDF Trish sent=== 

RS:we have a need here for OCI to work on all OCI terms and then bounce these to OBI branches. Will also need a model for the env. ontology. So OBI branch editors would validate a term from the community.
AR:we need to allow users not to figure out parent class
LF:they should feel bad if they don't give a definition
AR:some field are more important than others, parent class is not so important
LF:now relation is a branch and may need a different workflow
CS:relations are included in the workflow, do we need more?
AL:needs a few changes as we will not merge files as we expected previously. Had asked to add a bit about reasoning, and Trish did that. 
AR:Need to specify which reasoner, no unspecified OWL classes etc. Need the OWL-DL version is checked. Liju need to check the asserted h'archy to verify the modelling. 
AR:need to save and need branches to check their inferred version is correct

Problem that there's a shortage of OWL literate developers to do reasoning etc. How does that effect the workflow.

GF:we do classification routinely in our group. I would not mind doing that and I am set up for it. Would be doing an import and passing around. 
AR:Chris Mungall has set up for OBO Pellet reasoning to produce a daily report we could also do that
SS:need a pool of people with this expertise, GF, Daniel S, James, Alan, Alison
GF:relations between terms is pretty far down. This will be an iterative process, some relations will be merged, needs a loop to represent that. Most issues will be on file merging. 
RS:suggests major and minor release pattern


* <b>AA:SOP needs changing to deal with the state of the art workflow. Ask Trish to post on wiki and get a mac literate volunteer as SW is mac only</b>

* <b>GF volunteered to do the reasoning. Other people were also identified with these skills: AR, JM, DS, AL that could also assist, these are core developers with technical skills amd experience to do this. Reasoning needs to be done prior to release</b>

*<b>We will publish the asserted and the inferred h'archy and make it clear which these are. May be case that the tools will limit what can be saved, e.g. if invalid may not be able to save</b>

*<b>Need to modify the SOP to reflect what to do if reasoning produces errors ie. send to core developers</b>

===12. suggestion to do some work on experiment design, goal, etc beginning to end example suggested by Kevin and Alan===

[[ExperimentWorkedExample]] As emailed from Kevin Clancy

S/sheet [[http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pMHNWhGPKI1KNzA5ogDAkBQ&hl=en_GB]]

Long Discussion whether to model an instance of a hypothesis, or the components and relns between obi classes e.g. object, subject are related to hypothesis. Bill suggests we take a look at [[http://esw.w3.org/topic/HCLS/OntologyTaskForce/OboPhenotypeSyntaxExperiment]] and EXPO was also referenced as having addressed this before. Modeling it has value as we can extrapolate to other cases. Problem about modelling an instantiated hypothesis, as is statements are expected to be true, hypothesis may not be true and this presents a modelling problem. Same is true in cases where record exp. knowledge over time, and are represented as true but may not be. There's a scope question, should instantiated hypotheses be in OBI, is this in scope for us.

We are treading a line between knowledge base and high level modeling, modeling both here as an exercise is seen to have value as we will identify holes in the ontology and 

We proceed with the modeling in OBI, and also summarised on the spreadsheet attached above.

 






===13. Competency questions, testing and evaluation===

Daniel and James have volunteered for this.  This requires input from everyone however in terms of developing use cases along with competency questions.

===14. Structure in general, branch organisation===

===15. Use of mailing lists, traffic etc===

===16. Stable set of core OBI or at least terms/def (that can be used asap) ===

===17. NSF proposal details from Alan===
