'''Collab with Envo'''

JM: We have some sample information in AE which relates to Envo scope
NM: Env are holes or sites with qualities that enable the area or site to support life is current thinking. Env sampling would be taking some quantity from this area or site. I assume you would want to represent env sample from the point of a sample going through an assay.
MC: If you have bacteria in an organism then the organism is an environment, so is it a role?
BP: So we don't have environment at moment, we will have sample collected from site in OBI.
